As I did this too regular and missed my VS Code setup, I decided to give code coverage in VS Code a try.</p><p><img src=/images/Swift-Coverage-for-VS-Code/example-xcode.png alt="Code Coverage in Xcode"></p><p>After some research, I mostly found code coverage extensions for JS or other languages. Though I never found an extension supporting the llvm-cov-format produced by <code>swift test --enable-code-coverage</code> at <code>.build/*/debug/codecov/*.json</code> out of the box. There are solutions like converting this coverage file to <code>lcov.info</code>, but this would always require some setup in every project. So I started my own.</p><p>As I really liked the idea of other extensions to highlight the code itself, I decided to adopt this idea. Though many highlight covered code using a green background, which feels too heavy for always being activated. So I decided to only highlight covered expressions by default.</p><p><img src=/images/Swift-Coverage-for-VS-Code/example-vscode.png alt="Code Coverage in VS Code with Swift Coverage"></p><p>To get started, install <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.swift-coverage">Swift Coverage - Visual Studio Marketplace</a> and run your tests using <code>swift test --enable-code-coverage</code>.</p><p>Whenever you need to update your coverage statistics, simple re-run your tests.
That&rsquo;s it!</p><p>Are you using <a href=https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment>Maintained Swift Development Environment</a>?
To keep your coverage always up to date set <code>sde.swiftBuildingParams</code> setting to <code>["test", "--enable-code-coverage"]</code> to run all your unit tests on every change. Might not be a good idea with a slow test suite, but in smaller projects, this is super great.</p><p>Is there something you are missing for Swift and VS Code?
