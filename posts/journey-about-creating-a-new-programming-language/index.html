All developed in order to develop. They were those magical blackboxes, that felt beyond everything I could achieve.</p><p>Later I played around with various language features and writing my own standard library replacement for existing languages. Lots of fun, but not productive.</p><p>With the years, I learned new paradigms like object orientation, logical, constraint and functional programming. And beyond those big paradigms, there are many different concepts that define the languages character like the module system, dependencies, inheritance, generics, operator overloading, interfaces, type classes, strong or weak typing, dynamic or static, side-effects, monads and many more.</p><p>I started experimenting with new programming language concepts, mixing a few and thinking about the consequences. How do these features integrate and what does it mean for a different group of features? And which syntax do you need to support the special characteristics?</p><p>For fun, I worked on small libraries and tooling in existing programming language ecosystems. Nothing special or widespread.
I read about compilers and interpreters and even though I implemented small lisp-like languages and custom parsers, I felt like I couldn’t write a compiler on my own.</p><p>I kept the wish to design and create my own programming language from ground up. With tooling. I want to learn every aspect of it. Run into problems. Solve them and gradually increase the maturity of the language, the tooling and the compiler.</p><p>That being said, I don’t want my language to be used in wild, heck I encourage you to <em>not</em> use it. The journey and what we learn along the way is the treasure.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>I decided to create yet another programming language and let’s be honest: nobody will ever use it and I’m fine with it. But anyway I will still provide tooling and documentation for it.</p><p>I will update and link all my compiler and language design blog posts here.</p><p>If you wish, check out the open source repository of <a href=https://github.com/vknabel/lithia>Lithia</a>.
