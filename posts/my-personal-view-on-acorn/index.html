My experience with Acorn and Kubernetes
Before we dive right in, I&rsquo;d like to let you know about my level of experience with Kubernetes and Acorn.
I started having a look on Acorn in August 2022 and played around with it. I did not have production experience with Kubernetes, but I started learning and playing around with it a few months before."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:url" content="https://vknabel.com/posts/my-personal-view-on-acorn/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="vknabel"><meta property="og:title" content="My Personal View on Acorn"><meta property="og:description" content="Acorn is an application deployment framework for k8s, that tries to simplify instead of introducing another layer of indirection.

I did not have production experience with Kubernetes, but I started learning and playing around with it a few months before.</p><p>To get a deeper understanding on k8s, I soon started to migrate my personal services hosted on multiple docker-compose-files. Later I had a look on Acorn and started to play around with it. I also translated my docker-compose-files and k8s manifests to Acorn and liked the result.</p><p>Later I migrated my personal production services to k8s and Acorn. As <a href=http://github.com/vknabel/puffery>Puffery</a> only has a few users, there wasn&rsquo;t much risk involved.</p><p>On October 2022, I held a talk about <a href=https://acorn.io>Acorn</a> at the <a href=https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-munich-presents-kubernetes-community-days-munich-2022-1/>Kubernetes Community Days Munich 2022</a>. And recently I wrote the <a href=https://www.x-cellent.com/posts/getting-started-with-acorn-for-kubernetes>corresponding blog post</a> for my employer&rsquo;s blog to share the contents of the talk.</p><h2 id=secrets>Secrets</h2><p>Acorn forces you to declare secrets in the <code>Acornfile</code>, but it forbids you to provide them there. Instead it will automatically generate the secrets on the initial deployment. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about secrets anymore.</p><p>The weird part is, when you have an existing secret. You don&rsquo;t override or change the generated secret. Instead you create a new secret at the command line and link both secrets together.</p><p>But if you are used to it, it&rsquo;s actually a nice way to solve this issue.</p><h2 id=referencing-resources>Referencing Resources</h2><p>In Acorn you need to reference some resources like a specific secret or volume. Here you use an URL with the appropriate scheme. For example, to reference a secret, you use the <code>secret://</code> scheme.</p><p>In regards to volumes, this is awesome, as you can even mount a specific path of the volume into a directory. But when using secrets, this is sometimes a bit annoying, as you need to reference the whole secret and then extract the value you need, like <code>secret://db-password/token</code>. The benefit: you can create a secret to mount multiple files into a container using an opaque secret.</p><p>I understand the reasoning behind using resource URLs, as these resources technically need to be created and are not part of the Acorn Image. But in the beginning this was a bit confusing. Maybe this is just a documentation issue.</p><h2 id=development>Development</h2><p>For development we always need a vast range of tools. Especially when working with multiple programming languages. I tend to avoid installing those on my local machine and instead use containers. In easier cases I use <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">Remote Containers</a> for VS Code. For more complex use cases that include databases, I rely on docker-compose. But if the application needs to run in a Kubernetes cluster, it would be twice the work to maintain the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> and the k8s manifests. With Acorn, I can use the same manifests for development and production. Of course I need to sprinkle some <code>if</code> statements in the <code>Acornfile</code> to make it work for both environments, but it feels much more natural than maintaining two different sets of manifests.</p><p>And to be honest, I think an <code>Acornfile</code> is far easier to read, than a <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> or many k8s manifests.</p><h2 id=production-use>Production Use</h2><p>I have been using Acorn in production for a few months now and I have not encountered any problems so far.
Instead I really like gathering all logs of one application with a single command out of the box: <code>acorn logs [app]</code>.</p><p>I also like the fact, that Acorn knows the concept of an app. That way it can provide a great overview about whole applications across multiple resource types.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>I really like Acorn and I think it&rsquo;s a great tool to simplify the deployment of applications to Kubernetes. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s a great start. At the moment I&rsquo;m not sure if I would use it for a production application with a lot of users, but I would definitely use it for my personal projects.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/kubernetes>kubernetes</a></li><li><a href=/tags/acorn>acorn</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/vknabel rel=me title=GitHub><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#github"/></svg></a><a class=border></a><a class=soc href=https://mastodon.social/@vknabel/ rel=me title=Mastodon><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#at-sign"/></svg></a><a class=border></a></div><div class=footer-info>2025 © Valentin Knabel | <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
