You must declare it.</p><p>For Swift CLI dependencies there is no such system yet.
And that has been the reason why I created Rock for the Swift Ecosystem.
I want everyone to be able to submit their own projects (like CocoaPods) but support decentralized (and private) architectures, too (like Carthage and SwiftPM).
Therefore Rock only focuses on Swift CLIs has been built to work seamlessly with Swift Package Manager projects.</p><p>Do you see the same or other problems? Do you have a different opinion?
I would be really happy to receive some feedback from you.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/swift>swift</a></li><li><a href=/tags/cli>cli</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/vknabel rel=me title=GitHub><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#github"/></svg></a><a class=border></a><a class=soc href=https://mastodon.social/@vknabel/ rel=me title=Mastodon><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#at-sign"/></svg></a><a class=border></a></div><div class=footer-info>2025 © Valentin Knabel | <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
