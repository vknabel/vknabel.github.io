And a macOS app better integrates into your daily workflow.</p><p>Of course, you can use your Shortcuts from your iOS device. But what&rsquo;s special on macOS is the ability to pin specific workflows to the dock or the status bar. Even adding workflows to your share menus is possible!</p><p>No need to open Puffery directly if you don&rsquo;t want to. No distractions.</p><p>If you are a user of macOS widgets, you are covered, too! They work exactly the same way as on iOS.</p><h2 id=puffery-for-the-command-line>Puffery for the command line</h2><p><img src=./puffery-cli-showcase.png alt></p><p>With the next announcement, we are slowly moving outside of the Apple ecosystem. Puffery is now available as a command line tool. Currently it has a limited scope and has not yet received feature parity with the iOS or macOS apps, but it does not only support macOS, but also Linux <em>and</em> Windows.</p><p>It provides a tui / text based interface to scroll through lists of channels and messages. You can also send messages to a previously selected channel.</p><p>You can even signup or login with your existing account.</p><p>To give it a try, have a look on the <a href=https://github.com/vknabel/go-puffery#installation>puffery installation instructions</a>.</p><p>It has been built in Go and <a href=https://charm.sh/>Charm</a>&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea>Bubble Tea library</a>. As all of Puffery, it is open source and licensed under the <a href=https://github.com/vknabel/go-puffery/blob/main/LICENSE>MIT license</a>.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/puffery>puffery</a></li><li><a href=/tags/cli>cli</a></li><li><a href=/tags/announcement>announcement</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/vknabel rel=me title=GitHub><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#github"/></svg></a><a class=border></a><a class=soc href=https://mastodon.social/@vknabel/ rel=me title=Mastodon><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#at-sign"/></svg></a><a class=border></a></div><div class=footer-info>2025 © Valentin Knabel | <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
