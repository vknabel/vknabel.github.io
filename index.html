It has been designed to be an experiment, that is able to teach some lessons and that can be fulfilled.</p>&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/the-current-state-of-lithia-after-2-years/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/my-personal-view-on-acorn/>My Personal View on Acorn</a></h1><time>Dec 12, 2022</time><br><div class=description><p><a href=https://acorn.io>Acorn</a> is an application deployment framework for k8s, that tries to simplify instead of introducing another layer of indirection.
