&lt;p&gt;Most notably this affects my VS Code extensions for Swift.
I archieved the repositories and requested to deprecate the extensions in the Visual Studio Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I decided to stop my work on my toy programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reasoning"&gt;Reasoning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a few years I shifted my focus from Swift development to Go and Kubernetes and switched my main editor from VS Code to Helix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I found joy in so many different things that can be done without computers. Doing some side projects just isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the hassle for me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I will still write some blog posts and update my non-archived repositories.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zirric: Going Virtual</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/2025-09-28-going-virtual/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/2025-09-28-going-virtual/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago while I started working on &lt;a href="https://code.knabel.dev/lithia-lang/lithia"&gt;Lithia&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to use whatever takes me to my goal. Getting finished was the primary focus. And I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://code.knabel.dev/zirric-lang/zirric"&gt;Zirric&lt;/a&gt; I want to take less compromise and build a better language. Performance and portability aren&amp;rsquo;t completely irrelevant anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post is part of a &lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/posts/journey-about-creating-a-new-programming-language/"&gt;Journey about creating a new programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-tree-walker"&gt;The Tree Walker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Lithia I chose to implement a tree walker interpreter. It is simple to implement and easy to understand. The downside is that it&amp;rsquo;s slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the interpreter walks the abstract syntax tree (AST) and executes the program directly. This means that every time a function is called, the AST nodes for that function have to be traversed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this approach every node in the AST has an &lt;code&gt;evaluate&lt;/code&gt; method that takes the current context as a parameter. The context holds variable bindings and other state information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variables and constants were stored in a map. During every variable access, a lookup with the string name of the variable had to be performed. In case of a miss, a parent context had to be checked as well until the variable was found or the global context was reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-lithia" data-lang="lithia"&gt;let a = &amp;#34;global&amp;#34;

func do { =&amp;gt;
 let b = &amp;#34;local&amp;#34;

 print a // lookup &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; in current context -&amp;gt; miss -&amp;gt; lookup &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; in parent context -&amp;gt; hit
 print b // lookup &amp;#34;b&amp;#34; in current context -&amp;gt; hit
}

do // looks up the function &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; and calls it
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally checking the type of a value wasn&amp;rsquo;t trivial as well as the types had to be looked up by name as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore Lithia leverages lazy evaluation, which means that expressions are not evaluated until their value is needed. This adds additional overhead as every expression has to be wrapped in a thunk (a parameterless function).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this makes the second problem of this clear: everything is hidden behind pointers and in general everything is kind of costly. Not necessarily in terms of complexity, its just slow like hashing strings multiple times per variable access, checking if everything has been evaluated and last but not least it can&amp;rsquo;t be cached efficiently by the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-bytecode-interpreter"&gt;The Bytecode Interpreter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zirric takes a different approach to this. It defines a virtual machine (VM) that executes bytecode instructions. Zirric&amp;rsquo;s VM is stack based, which is comparable for a simple calculator or a deck of cards: each operation works on the topmost elements of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bytecode itself is separated of all constants. Instead these are in a separate array or slice while the bytecode references them by index.
In case of the expression &lt;code&gt;40 + 2&lt;/code&gt;, the constant &lt;code&gt;40&lt;/code&gt; is at index &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; is at index &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. The human readable bytecode to add these two numbers is then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# 1 + 2
Cons 0 # Pushes the constant at index 0 (40) onto the stack
Cons 1 # Pushes the constant at index 1 (2) onto the stack
Add
# Result: 42
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual bytecode currently looks like this: &lt;code&gt;01 00 00 01 00 01 10&lt;/code&gt;. Neat, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VM iterates over the bytecode instructions and executes them one by one.
Here &lt;code&gt;Cons&lt;/code&gt; loads the constant with the fitting index onto the stack. &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; pops the top two elements from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.
That way the stack of the VM grows and shrinks as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to variables, the VM uses a different approach as well: each variable gets an index assigned at compile time. That way variable access is just a matter of looking up an index of a single array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s get back to our example from above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-lithia" data-lang="lithia"&gt;let a = &amp;#34;global&amp;#34; // globals[0] = constants[0]

func do() { // functions are constants: constants[1]
 let b = &amp;#34;local&amp;#34; // locals[0] = constants[2]

 print(a) // globals[0]
 print(b) // locals[0]
}

do() // constants[1]()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;No more string lookups. No more parent contexts. Just direct index access.
And the best part of this: the CPU can cache this data much more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about laziness? Almost everything is now eagerly evaluated. Expressions are evaluated as soon as they are encountered.
Though there are a few exceptions like logical operators (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;) which skip their right hand side if the result is already determined by the left hand side. This is common and does not add much overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Zirric globals are still initialized lazily. More on this in a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-that-hassle"&gt;Why that hassle?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpreters are much easier to implement and to understand. Is this actually worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glad you asked! I made some micro benchmarks for Lithia and Zirric. In this case I wrote a simple recursive Fibonacci function in both languages and measured the time it takes to compute for several numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microbenchmarks can be misleading and do not reflect real world performance. But as long as we keep all tests as similar as possible, we can get a rough idea of the performance difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Lithia version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-lithia" data-lang="lithia"&gt;func fib { n =&amp;gt;
 if (n &amp;lt; 2), n, (fib n - 1) + (fib n - 2)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the Zirric version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-zirric" data-lang="zirric"&gt;func fib(n) {
	return if n &amp;lt; 2 {
		n
	} else {
		fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)				
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both languages are implemented in Go, I used the builtin Go benchmarking for both to keep it as similar as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these are the results on my machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Input&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Repetitions&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Lithia&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Repetitions&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Zirric&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Factor&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
 &lt;tbody&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;5,338 sec&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1,000,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0.1101 ns&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;4,848,486&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;13,990 sec&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1,000,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0.2860 ns&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;4,891,832&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;36,805 sec&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1,000,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0.7305 ns&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;5,038,386&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;(too long)&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;34,238 sec&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;(too long)&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first saw these results, I had to check if I messed something up. We are comparing seconds with nanoseconds here. That&amp;rsquo;s why I added another run with &lt;code&gt;fib(40)&lt;/code&gt; for Zirric to validate the tests. And they were right. Zirric is nearly &lt;em&gt;five million&lt;/em&gt; times faster than Lithia in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get some more context, I also measured the Python and Ruby &lt;code&gt;fib(40)&lt;/code&gt; and got around 10 to 17 seconds here. Although these numbers are not accurate and probably estimated too high, they give a rough idea of the performance difference. Zirric is multiple times slower than these languages, but still in the same ballpark, while Lithia is outclassed by magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zirric is still in early development. Through optimization, new language features but also additional safe guards the performance profile will change over time. And probably not always for the better. Also this is just a microbenchmark that is not in favor of Lithia. Real world performance might be different. Take these numbers with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, this was worth the hassle.

Now it is available in version v0.0.19. Infrequently I also wrote some words about it on this blog.
It has been designed to be an experiment, that is able to teach some lessons and that can be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a programming language being able to teach lessons, a Standard Library and of course some programs need to exist. Only the experience of its developers can lead to conclusions.
Now it’s time to derive those!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post is part of a &lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/posts/journey-about-creating-a-new-programming-language/"&gt;Journey about creating a new programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-current-state"&gt;The current state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first let’s have a look on the current state of Lithia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithia has all planned features implemented. You can define &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;-structures, &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;s similar to unions, functions, constants, modules and imports, closures, partial application of parameters and lazy evaluation.
The standard library currently consists of 19 modules providing base types, helpers around comparisons, strings, results and more, file system access and a micro-framework to write unit tests in and for Lithia. Every module is fully documented and is generated by a Lithia script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To declare packages and to make project-based scripts easily accessible, there is the &lt;code&gt;Potfile&lt;/code&gt; (comparable to &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;Taskfile&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the performance of the Lithia interpreter has largely improved in the early days but it’s still slow and leaves room for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing Lithia is fueled by the Visual Studio Code extension which relies on the Language Server within the Lithia binary and does not need to be installed separately.
It provides syntax highlighting, diagnostics and autocompletion. Additionally to the LSP there is a tree-sitter grammar which can be used in other modern editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-developer-experience"&gt;The Developer Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the development experience in such a young programming language doesn’t reach the ease of use of mature ones. But for a scripting it provides decent autocompletion.
Though there are no formatters or linters, yet. And currently there is no debugger support, which is a bummer. In practice this at least encourages the use of unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithia has a dynamic but strict type system, which may lead to runtime errors, which is okay for scripting. But the mix of lazy evaluation often further delays and hides these runtime errors and make debugging unnecessarily hard. Especially when adding concurrency. This needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option for improvement is the current parens-less call syntax: instead of &lt;code&gt;f(g(x), y)&lt;/code&gt; you write &lt;code&gt;f g x, y&lt;/code&gt;. With great syntax highlighting this is something you get around, but syntax should be self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s also missing is a real package manager although git submodules at least provide a workaround for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general Lithia as an experiment was successful and lead to really great results. The simplicity but power of the type system is a breeze. But Lithia needs a change. And at its core lazy evaluation needs to be dropped, while the overall tooling should evolve.
But what’s still missing is the perfect use case that perfectly fits Lithia’s language features.
The upcoming release v0.1.0 should provide answers and solutions for those pain points.&lt;/p&gt;

I won&amp;rsquo;t cover all details and problems it tries to solve here, instead I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some experiences and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acorn has been discontinued&lt;/strong&gt; and they are now doing some AI slop stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-experience-with-acorn-and-kubernetes"&gt;My experience with Acorn and Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive right in, I&amp;rsquo;d like to let you know about my level of experience with Kubernetes and Acorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started having a look on Acorn in August 2022 and played around with it. I did not have production experience with Kubernetes, but I started learning and playing around with it a few months before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a deeper understanding on k8s, I soon started to migrate my personal services hosted on multiple docker-compose-files. Later I had a look on Acorn and started to play around with it. I also translated my docker-compose-files and k8s manifests to Acorn and liked the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I migrated my personal production services to k8s and Acorn. As &lt;a href="http://github.com/vknabel/puffery"&gt;Puffery&lt;/a&gt; only has a few users, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much risk involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 2022, I held a talk about &lt;a href="https://acorn.io"&gt;Acorn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-munich-presents-kubernetes-community-days-munich-2022-1/"&gt;Kubernetes Community Days Munich 2022&lt;/a&gt;. And recently I wrote the &lt;a href="https://www.x-cellent.com/posts/getting-started-with-acorn-for-kubernetes"&gt;corresponding blog post&lt;/a&gt; for my employer&amp;rsquo;s blog to share the contents of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="secrets"&gt;Secrets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acorn forces you to declare secrets in the &lt;code&gt;Acornfile&lt;/code&gt;, but it forbids you to provide them there. Instead it will automatically generate the secrets on the initial deployment. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about secrets anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weird part is, when you have an existing secret. You don&amp;rsquo;t override or change the generated secret. Instead you create a new secret at the command line and link both secrets together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are used to it, it&amp;rsquo;s actually a nice way to solve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="referencing-resources"&gt;Referencing Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acorn you need to reference some resources like a specific secret or volume. Here you use an URL with the appropriate scheme. For example, to reference a secret, you use the &lt;code&gt;secret://&lt;/code&gt; scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to volumes, this is awesome, as you can even mount a specific path of the volume into a directory. But when using secrets, this is sometimes a bit annoying, as you need to reference the whole secret and then extract the value you need, like &lt;code&gt;secret://db-password/token&lt;/code&gt;. The benefit: you can create a secret to mount multiple files into a container using an opaque secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the reasoning behind using resource URLs, as these resources technically need to be created and are not part of the Acorn Image. But in the beginning this was a bit confusing. Maybe this is just a documentation issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="development"&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For development we always need a vast range of tools. Especially when working with multiple programming languages. I tend to avoid installing those on my local machine and instead use containers. In easier cases I use &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"&gt;Remote Containers&lt;/a&gt; for VS Code. For more complex use cases that include databases, I rely on docker-compose. But if the application needs to run in a Kubernetes cluster, it would be twice the work to maintain the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yaml&lt;/code&gt; and the k8s manifests. With Acorn, I can use the same manifests for development and production. Of course I need to sprinkle some &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements in the &lt;code&gt;Acornfile&lt;/code&gt; to make it work for both environments, but it feels much more natural than maintaining two different sets of manifests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be honest, I think an &lt;code&gt;Acornfile&lt;/code&gt; is far easier to read, than a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yaml&lt;/code&gt; or many k8s manifests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="production-use"&gt;Production Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Acorn in production for a few months now and I have not encountered any problems so far.
Instead I really like gathering all logs of one application with a single command out of the box: &lt;code&gt;acorn logs [app]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like the fact, that Acorn knows the concept of an app. That way it can provide a great overview about whole applications across multiple resource types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like Acorn and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great tool to simplify the deployment of applications to Kubernetes. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s a great start. At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I would use it for a production application with a lot of users, but I would definitely use it for my personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Open Policy Agent</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/2022-08-15-open-policy-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/2022-08-15-open-policy-agent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With OPA you implement decisions of policies, not their enforcement.

Though as I run minikube on my Mac, I experienced multiple bugs regarding accessing the cluster and it&amp;rsquo;s published ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my perspective Kind works much better, is faster, more stable on macOS and allows the creation of multiple clusters. Though it is not bug-free on macOS. Although most bugs seem to be related to Docker itself on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even pause the cluster - just pause it&amp;rsquo;s docker container.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bash scripts with Gum</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/2022-08-03-bash-scripts-with-gum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/2022-08-03-bash-scripts-with-gum/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I gave the newest tool of Charm &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum"&gt;Gum&lt;/a&gt; a try.
It allows to create interactive bash scripts in just a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case I gave it a try for Kubernetes. I often want to look at the logs of a pod, but the exact k8s pod differs from time to time.
And sometimes I forget the exact namespace or the pod&amp;rsquo;s name includes random characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;#! /bin/bash
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# let the user select a namespace&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;kubectl get namespaces -o name | gum choose | cut -d/ -f2&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# let the user select a pod of the namespace&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;POD&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;kubectl get pods -n &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$NAMESPACE&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; | tail -n +2 | gum choose | cut -d&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; -f1&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# if you want to repeat, copy the command&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;gt; kubectl logs -n \&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$NAMESPACE&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;\&amp;#34; \&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$POD&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# print the logs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;kubectl logs -n &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$NAMESPACE&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$POD&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow other&amp;rsquo;s channels and directly receive updates. There is no algorithm that decides wether you should receive notifications or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning scripting is part of puffery&amp;rsquo;s DNA: you were able to send messages with Siri Shortcuts and a simple &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to take a deeper look, feel free to check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/puffery"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; including the Swift Server written in Vapor, and the iOS app built with SwiftUI in a single mono-repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="puffery-for-macos"&gt;Puffery for macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./puffery-macos-showcase.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do no share your channels, sending and receiving messages and thus push notifications from the same iOS device is kind of useless in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of your most productive time of the day, you are probably sitting in front of your Mac. And a macOS app better integrates into your daily workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can use your Shortcuts from your iOS device. But what&amp;rsquo;s special on macOS is the ability to pin specific workflows to the dock or the status bar. Even adding workflows to your share menus is possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to open Puffery directly if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to. No distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a user of macOS widgets, you are covered, too! They work exactly the same way as on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="puffery-for-the-command-line"&gt;Puffery for the command line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./puffery-cli-showcase.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the next announcement, we are slowly moving outside of the Apple ecosystem. Puffery is now available as a command line tool. Currently it has a limited scope and has not yet received feature parity with the iOS or macOS apps, but it does not only support macOS, but also Linux &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides a tui / text based interface to scroll through lists of channels and messages. You can also send messages to a previously selected channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even signup or login with your existing account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give it a try, have a look on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/go-puffery#installation"&gt;puffery installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been built in Go and &lt;a href="https://charm.sh/"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea"&gt;Bubble Tea library&lt;/a&gt;. As all of Puffery, it is open source and licensed under the &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/go-puffery/blob/main/LICENSE"&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ultra-fast Hugo GitHub actions</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/2022-07-24-ultra-fast-hugo-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/2022-07-24-ultra-fast-hugo-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I created a &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vknabel.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yml"&gt;GitHub workflow&lt;/a&gt; to automatically build and deploy my website to GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

Every programming language is unique in its own way. Your goal is to find out in which way. And you need to find your reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you want to create it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to solve a particular problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it for learning purposes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For who do you build the language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who should use it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the answers in mind during the whole design process: they will guide you into the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I designed &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/lithia"&gt;Lithia&lt;/a&gt; for myself to learn and explore all sorts of tooling around programming and to create them myself. And that&amp;rsquo;s also the focus of the language: tooling around itself. Learning by doing is king here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post is part of a &lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/posts/journey-about-creating-a-new-programming-language/"&gt;Journey about creating a new programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-initial-take-on-designing-lithia"&gt;My initial take on designing Lithia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like functional programming, but I value being able to perform changes imperatively when I need to. I like the idea of lazy evaluation and being able to create infinite data structures, but to only execute needed parts. And the stronger your type system is, the more errors can be caught at compile time. Some downsides like verbosity can be reduced by type inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing functional algorithms really work well with enumerations where every case may have attributes or associated values. It should also be possible to add scoped methods to already declared classes or data types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And generics are great, let‘s stuff generics in there. Great nice language. How long will I take to implement it? Well…, scrap that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let‘s start all over.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every programming language special on its own way. To define each characteristic of it, you not only need to know the language features, but the intentionally missing ones, naming conventions, typical patterns, the standard library and how everything is tied together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all defines the programming language. Everything is a tradeoff. For example, every piece of syntactic sugar makes your language more expressive, but harder to read. Every new feature needs to be learned and understood correctly. And every feature may be used in the wrong places or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-language-is-worth-to-implement"&gt;What language is worth to implement?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‘s be honest: programming languages tend to be on the bigger side of projects and we all have limited time, energy and motivation. And there are plenty of programming languages out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does your language fit between all those other already finished languages? Are you solving niche problems? Are you experimenting with new language concepts or are you mixing seemingly unrelated paradigms? And more importantly: why do &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; want to implement it yourself? Are you able to even finish it? How do you keep your motivation up in the long term?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decided to start working on a compiler or interpreter, be sure to be able to finish it and expect you will be the only one using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what‘s my case? Lithia does not solve a particular problem, but it enables me to learn about the inner workings of compilers, interpreters and the tooling around it. I want a green field to build all kinds of tooling. And in case there is a limitation or bug, I can fix or embrace and document it. What can be achieved in a specific field is not limited by external factors, only by my time, energy and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="its-about-the-scope-and-milestones"&gt;It’s about the scope and milestones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know, the planned Lithia is not going to be able to compete with whole language ecosystems or programming languages that shine through lots of features. I wouldn’t be able to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the scope must be reduced. Even more as the language should be accompanied by tooling, coming with a huge scope increase!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But great tooling requires meta data like types to operate on and the compiler needs to support all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There need to be compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I need continuous wins to keep my motivation high. Once there is a basic implementation, I want to do some simple stuff, while working on a complex subsystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithia needs to shine through the absence of many features. Instead it should focus on few key concepts, that support requirements for tooling. And after all, it should be a language I like to program in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, Lithia…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is a simple language with only a few features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports tooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows a few quick wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is conceptually attracting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lithia-is-an-experiment"&gt;Lithia is an experiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer mostly functional programming languages with a shot of imperative programming. In that context I also favour lazy over strict evaluation and love currying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy vs strict evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt; expressions will only be evaluated if their value is actually needed in lazy evaluation. With strict evaluation they will always be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currying&lt;/strong&gt;: let’s imagine you have a function with two parameters, but you currently have just the first parameter. With currying you can pass just the first one and you will receive a function that accepts the second parameter. Without currying you‘d need to manually create that function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithia won’t allow direct mutations of variables. There will only be constants. I didn’t want to explicitly forbid any mutations, but at this stage I didn’t know how they fit into the language, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; lazy evaluation and directly mutating variables might lead to weird behaviour. And what about types of a variable? May they change at any time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type system should be easy to bootstrap, but should enable static analysis in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s my baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="type-system"&gt;Type System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variables, parameters and functions won&amp;rsquo;t have an explicit type annotation like Java&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;String name&lt;/code&gt;, Swift&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;let name: String&lt;/code&gt; or Go&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;var name string&lt;/code&gt;. If there would be type annotations, Lithia would need to enforce them right from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead Lithia should have an easy to bootstrap dynamic type system, that still enables static analysis. The easiest way is not to allow structural manipulation of types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far can we get with type inference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="base-types"&gt;Base Types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two basic kinds of types to support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;types like classes and structs with independent properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;types like enums that list all possible values. In some languages enums may have associated properties, thus mixing sum and product types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect are reference and value types and semantics. How should changes propagate through the different parts of your program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lithia there will be one type with properties called &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; without any inheritance or methods like classes have. They will have a list of untyped properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if upcoming code snippets look unfamiliar – we will cover the syntax in another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;data Example {
 firstProperty
 secondProperty
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here is an optimisation for tooling: if you want to store a function within your &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;, you can add all its parameters &lt;code&gt;firstProperty param, and, more&lt;/code&gt;. When the tooling and the compiler mature, they can detect errors and improve autocompletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lithia, the &lt;em&gt;enum&lt;/em&gt; type breaks with common interpretations. Here an &lt;em&gt;enum&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a direct list of possible values, but a list of possible types, called a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change from individual values to more generic types should make the currently rather static language feel more dynamic and like a scripting language for lovers of strong typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-type-switch"&gt;The type switch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have enums, we need to resolve those types. A type switch maps every type to a function. It requires the enum definition and returns a function that receives the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let increaseOptional = type Optional {
 Some: { some =&amp;gt; some.value + 1 },
 None: { none =&amp;gt; none }
}
increaseOptional (Some 1)
increaseOptional None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to provide functions to work on the enums within one module, that are reusable and higher level. This should reduce the amount of external type switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="standard-library"&gt;Standard Library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stdlib is a great place to get quick wins from once the most basic implementation of the language has been finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lithia the interpreter’s responsibility ends early. It defines Strings, Characters, numeric types, Functions and some more basic types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard Library called &lt;em&gt;prelude&lt;/em&gt; starts with famous types like Boolean and List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here there are many possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docs generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All kinds of basic data manipulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much, much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-didnt-make-it-to-lithia"&gt;What didn’t make it to Lithia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of all features that did not find any place in Lithia is longer than what did. All have their particular reasons and their absence fit into the concept of Lithia. Here are some honorable mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interfaces / protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensions / adding new methods to existing types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type casts and direct type testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom operators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overloading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variational arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I summarised my take on creating your own programming language. Don’t do it for glory, do it for yourself and the experience you gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design your scope and concept. Make sure you stay motivated until the end. Don’t hesitate to reevaluate your decisions. Take tiny steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this series will not teach you how to write your first own programming language on its own, it might be supplementary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of playing with the idea of writing my own programming language, I finally started. In the past I read books and blog posts about creating my own compiler, and I actually have written some parsers, but I never implemented the whole language itself. I know some theory, but I do not know how to actually apply it in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt stuck between theory and simple proof of concept implementations like creating another Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-in-this-series"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in this series?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all finished blog posts so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/posts/designing-and-scoping-my-language-lithia/"&gt;Designing and scoping my language Lithia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/posts/the-current-state-of-lithia-after-2-years/"&gt;The current state of Lithia after 2 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/posts/2025-09-28-going-virtual/"&gt;Zirric: The Virtual Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-motivations-and-background"&gt;My motivations and background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I learned programming, I was inspired by all the tooling like linters, editors and the compiler itself. All developed in order to develop. They were those magical blackboxes, that felt beyond everything I could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I played around with various language features and writing my own standard library replacement for existing languages. Lots of fun, but not productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the years, I learned new paradigms like object orientation, logical, constraint and functional programming. And beyond those big paradigms, there are many different concepts that define the languages character like the module system, dependencies, inheritance, generics, operator overloading, interfaces, type classes, strong or weak typing, dynamic or static, side-effects, monads and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started experimenting with new programming language concepts, mixing a few and thinking about the consequences. How do these features integrate and what does it mean for a different group of features? And which syntax do you need to support the special characteristics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fun, I worked on small libraries and tooling in existing programming language ecosystems. Nothing special or widespread.
I read about compilers and interpreters and even though I implemented small lisp-like languages and custom parsers, I felt like I couldn’t write a compiler on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept the wish to design and create my own programming language from ground up. With tooling. I want to learn every aspect of it. Run into problems. Solve them and gradually increase the maturity of the language, the tooling and the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I don’t want my language to be used in wild, heck I encourage you to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use it. The journey and what we learn along the way is the treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to create yet another programming language and let’s be honest: nobody will ever use it and I’m fine with it. But anyway I will still provide tooling and documentation for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will update and link all my compiler and language design blog posts here.&lt;/p&gt;

In late december 2021, the Swift Server Working group released a brand &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang"&gt;new extension for vscode&lt;/a&gt;, which dramatically improves debugging your Swift code. Especially for linux! Time for an update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running, debugging and developing your targets in Visual Studio Code is not prepared by default. Especially for us Swift developers this might come unexpected, especially in comparison to Xcode.
In VS Code we require extensions and configs for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to install the mentioned extension: &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang"&gt;Swift for Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s create a new project on open it in VS Code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ swift package init --type executable
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating executable package: MyProject
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Package.swift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating README.md
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating .gitignore
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Sources/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Sources/MyProject/main.swift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Tests/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Tests/MyProjectTests/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Tests/MyProjectTests/MyProjectTests.swift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ code . &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# if not found: open -a &amp;#34;Visual Studio Code&amp;#34; .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swift extension for VS Code will now generate some launch configurations within a &lt;code&gt;.vscode/launch.json&lt;/code&gt; file.
It generates release and debug &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb"&gt;LLDB&lt;/a&gt;-launch-configurations for each target and one launch configuration for each test target. Previously this step would have been manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we currently have one target &lt;code&gt;MyProject&lt;/code&gt; and one test target &lt;code&gt;MyProjectTests&lt;/code&gt;, we will have the following launch configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Debugging-Swift-in-VS-Code-in-2022/example_launch_configs.png" alt="Launch configs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note, that the &lt;code&gt;preLaunchTask&lt;/code&gt;s have been created, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;configurations&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: [
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;lldb&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;request&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;launch&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;Debug MyProject&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;program&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;${workspaceFolder:MyProject}/.build/debug/MyProject&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;args&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: [],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;cwd&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;${workspaceFolder:MyProject}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;preLaunchTask&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;swift: Build Debug MyProject&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;lldb&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;program&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;${workspaceFolder:MyProject}/.build/release/MyProject&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;args&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: [],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;cwd&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;${workspaceFolder:MyProject}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;preLaunchTask&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;swift: Build Release MyProject&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;lldb&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;request&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;launch&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;Test MyProject&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;program&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xctest&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;args&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;.build/debug/MyProjectPackageTests.xctest&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;cwd&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;${workspaceFolder:MyProject}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;preLaunchTask&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;swift: Build All&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; ]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we are ready to start debugging!
Let&amp;rsquo;s open &lt;code&gt;Sources/MyProject/main.swift&lt;/code&gt;, and add a breakpoint before executing &lt;code&gt;print(&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; by left-clicking the empty space before the line number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Debugging-Swift-in-VS-Code-in-2022/example_breakpoint.png" alt="Breakpoint in main.swift"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, switch to the &lt;code&gt;Run and Debug&lt;/code&gt; tab on the left, make sure &lt;code&gt;Debug MyProject&lt;/code&gt; is selected, and click the green run button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your project will be compiled, run and stops at the breakpoint!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Debugging-Swift-in-VS-Code-in-2022/example_debugging.png" alt="Stopped at breakpoint in main.swift"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly this approach currently does not work when debugging iOS or macOS apps, but Swift Package Manager projects and CLIs work great!
I hope you enjoy your increased productivity!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>UINavigationBar black after Xcode 13 upgrade</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/2021-11-19-uinavigationbar-black-after-xcode-13-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/2021-11-19-uinavigationbar-black-after-xcode-13-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In case your &lt;code&gt;UINavigationBar&lt;/code&gt; has been set to a custom color and the navigation bar is not translucent, you will experience a visual regression when updating to Xcode 13.
The navigation bar background will be black - until you start scrolling. Then it behaves as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully there is a workaround and an easy fix:

&lt;p&gt;Code editors like VS Code might highlight those characters depending on your config, but other websites don&amp;rsquo;t. In my case I copied a secret for my CI pipeline including the invisible character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy workaround for this on the mac: Spotlight removes some of these characters. A simple &lt;code&gt;cmd+space&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cmd+v&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cmd+a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cmd+c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; cleans the copied text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I used nvm, rvm, swiftenv and more. I now use asdf. Just add the plugin of your choice and install your desired versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only drawback is installing completely new versions of the tools. You are only able to install exact versions. You can&amp;rsquo;t install &lt;em&gt;some major 16 nodejs version&lt;/em&gt;.
But you can still install &lt;code&gt;asdf install &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt; latest&lt;/code&gt; or in case of nodejs &lt;code&gt;lts-*&lt;/code&gt; versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to pick the version locally or globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some side-tip: there is an &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-direnv"&gt;asdf plugin for direnv&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

And in &lt;a href="https://github.com/vapor/vapor/releases/tag/4.50.0"&gt;4.50.0&lt;/a&gt; Vapor added support for it, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are still on Vapor 3, you first need to &lt;a href="https://www.vknabel.com/pages/Upgrading-a-server-side-Swift-project-to-Vapor-4/"&gt;upgrade your server to Vapor 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can migrate most usages of Swift NIO&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;. But we don&amp;rsquo;t have to! This is not a breaking change. I recently performed this upgrade for the server of my app &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/puffery"&gt;Puffery&lt;/a&gt; and as both, the client and the server are open source I will include links to the respective git commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puffery&lt;/strong&gt; is an app to send messages into channels using Shortcuts or HTTP. This will trigger a push notification to all clients that have subscribed. Within the app you can view your messages and channels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend to directly replace all occurrences of &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt;. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t going to touch specific code paths in a while, there is no need to migrate those. But we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upgrading-to-swift-55"&gt;Upgrading to Swift 5.5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, you need to upgrade your Swift Tools Version within your &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt;-manifest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// swift-tools-version:5.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;PackageDescription&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a few lines later we need to upgrade to a newer macOS version, because &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; not only requires Swift 5.5, but also macOS 12 Monterey. Make sure you have upgraded accordingly. Otherwise you&amp;rsquo;d need to work on a linux machine or within a docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; package = Package(
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; name: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;PufferyServer&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; platforms: [
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; .macOS(.v12), &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// upgrade to .v12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; ],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up, we need to bump our dependencies. As we want to rely on special features of the new Vapor, we explicitly go &lt;code&gt;from: &amp;quot;4.50.0&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Repeat this with other dependencies like Fluent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; dependencies: [
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 .package(url: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;https://github.com/vapor/vapor.git&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, from: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;4.50.0&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// upgrade to 4.50.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, to silence a warning, we need to explicitly declare our &lt;code&gt;Run&lt;/code&gt; target as &lt;code&gt;executableTarget&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; targets: [
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 .executableTarget(name: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;Run&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, dependencies: [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;App&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]),
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use a Dockerfile, build &lt;code&gt;FROM swift:5.5 as build&lt;/code&gt;. Also if present don&amp;rsquo;t forget to update your &lt;code&gt;.swift-version&lt;/code&gt;-file and your CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now update your packages using &lt;code&gt;swift package update&lt;/code&gt;. If you use Xcode, also update your dependencies using &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; Packages &amp;gt; Update to Latest Package Versions&lt;/code&gt; to keep them in sync. In theory &lt;code&gt;swift build&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;swift test&lt;/code&gt; should run without any errors. If it does, fix those and proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/puffery/commit/1c41e5ae5c49748c1389b4491e03d595e5b0f406"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -am &amp;quot;Upgraded PufferyServer to Swift 5.5&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="adopting-async-await"&gt;Adopting Async Await&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we upgraded our new Swift version and updated our dependencies, let&amp;rsquo;s get started with our migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will incrementally do tiny steps and migrate every function after another. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to migrate all functions immediately. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t touched specific files in a while, there is no need to do so now. A great example are your database migrations. You won&amp;rsquo;t touch them anyways. Just write new ones with &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; and you are fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, controllers are the easiest place to get started. Later you can tackle migrate &lt;code&gt;Jobs&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ScheduledJob&lt;/code&gt;s. Then your services and your repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest places to upgrade will most likely be your Fluent queries: there are overloads for &lt;code&gt;.find()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.all()&lt;/code&gt; to return &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;async throws&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="migrate-the-function-signature"&gt;Migrate the function signature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;- 	func messagesForAllChannels(_ req: Request) throws -&amp;gt; EventLoopFuture&amp;lt;[MessageResponse]&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;+ 	func messagesForAllChannels(_ req: Request) async throws -&amp;gt; [MessageResponse] {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now fix all issues within the function. Then fix the errors of all callers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you temporarily converted invocations of this method from &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt; to an async function using &lt;code&gt;.get()&lt;/code&gt;, it is now time to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="migrate-protocol-methods-if-directly-affected"&gt;Migrate Protocol Methods if directly affected&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most protocols need to be prefixed with &lt;code&gt;Async&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code&gt;AsyncJob&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;AsyncScheduledJob&lt;/code&gt;. Then you can replace all function signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i-need-async-but-i-have-an-eventloopfuture"&gt;I need async, but I have an EventLoopFuture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert a not yet converted &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt;, we call &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&amp;lt;V&amp;gt;.get() async throws -&amp;gt; V&lt;/code&gt;. You can migrate the function later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; await theEventLoopFuture.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="i-need-an-eventloopfuture-but-i-have-an-async-function"&gt;I need an EventLoopFuture, but I have an async function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I decided to keep some function signatures as they were and I did not migrate them. For those cases I created a small helper function to create an &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt; from an async task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;EventLoop&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(task: @escaping () async &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;gt; T) -&amp;gt; EventLoopFuture&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; promise = makePromise(of: T.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; promise.completeWithTask { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; await task() }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; promise.futureResult
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example executing multiple futures in parallel is easy with &lt;code&gt;eventLoop.flatten&lt;/code&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s much harder with &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="migrate-flatmap"&gt;Migrate &lt;code&gt;.flatMap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrate &lt;code&gt;.flatMap({ messages in doSomething(messages) })&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;let result = try await doSomething(messages).get()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="migrate-flatmapthrowing"&gt;Migrate &lt;code&gt;.flatMapThrowing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrate &lt;code&gt;.flatMapThrowing({ messages in doSomething(messages) })&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;let result = try doSomething(messages)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="migrate-eventloopflatten"&gt;Migrate &lt;code&gt;eventLoop.flatten&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executing multiple futures in parallel is easy with &lt;code&gt;eventLoop.flatten&lt;/code&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s much harder with &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d recommend to keep this part as is, and to keep this part as &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt;.
See [I need an EventLoopFuture, but I have async](#I need an EventLoopFuture, but I have async).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="migrate-transformto"&gt;Migrate &lt;code&gt;.transform(to:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is straight forward: use the value directly. Typically you&amp;rsquo;d return this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I used &lt;code&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt; within a &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt; to keep the same return value. Now, just &lt;code&gt;try await&lt;/code&gt; these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-	.flatMap({ user in
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-		user.update(on: req.db)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-			.transform(to: user)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-	})
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;+	try await update(on: req.db)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="migrate-always_"&gt;Migrate &lt;code&gt;.always(_:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.always&lt;/code&gt; will be executed when an &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt; fails and when it succeeds. This is the same behaviour of &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;-	return computeSomething()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;- .always { _ in
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;- 	doSomething()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;- }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;+ defer {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;+		doSomething()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;+ }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;+	return try await computeSomething()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; you probably need to move your defer up. Using &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; will likely introduce more return and throw statements which will exit your functions early.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="returning-constant-futures"&gt;Returning constant futures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you currently throw a failing future, just throw the error directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;- return req.eventLoop.future(error: Abort(.notFound))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;+ throw Abort(.notFound)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To replace a succeeding future, return the value directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;- return req.eventLoop.future(success: value)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;+ return value
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If thee &lt;code&gt;future(error:)&lt;/code&gt; was embedded within a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; to lift errors to an &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt;, you can probably remove the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; and mark the function as &lt;code&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="test-and-commit"&gt;Test and Commit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to regularly run your tests and to keep your project in a green state. From time to time, do some commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="example-for-a-fluent-query"&gt;Example for a Fluent query&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function is part of the &lt;code&gt;SubscriptionRepository&lt;/code&gt;. It is meant to be used from &lt;code&gt;Controllers&lt;/code&gt; to consistently access, filter and sort the channel subscriptions of a user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;(of user: User) -&amp;gt; EventLoopFuture&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;[Subscription]&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; Subscription.query(on: db)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;			.filter(&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;Subscription.&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;user.&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;id == user.requireID())
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;			.sort(&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;createdAt, .descending)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;			.all()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	} &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; eventLoop.future(error: error)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start by changing the type signature to &lt;code&gt;async throws&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix the type errors, we could drop &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; as the new variant is throwing. Previously it wasn&amp;rsquo;t throwing as there is no overload of &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture.flatMap&lt;/code&gt; that accepts throwing &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt;s. Therefore &lt;code&gt;all(of:)&lt;/code&gt; was required to lift thrown errors to futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there is no distinction between directly throwing and a query failure with &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; we can get rid of the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt;. And as Fluent has overloads for both &lt;code&gt;EventLoopFuture&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;async throws&lt;/code&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re done here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;(of user: User) async &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;gt; [Subscription] {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;messagesForAllChannels&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; req: Request) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;gt; EventLoopFuture&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;[MessageResponse]&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; user = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; req.auth.require(User.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; req.subscriptions.all(of: user)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 .flatMap(req.messages.latestSubscribed(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;:))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; .flatMapThrowing { messages &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; messages.map {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; MessageResponse($0.message, subscription: $0.subscription)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;				}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// other endpoints ...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code should be familiar to any Vapor developer. I started migration with the function signature, replaced &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flatMapThrowing&lt;/code&gt; and inserted the &lt;code&gt;.get()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;messagesForAllChannels&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; req: Request) async &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;gt; [MessageResponse] {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; subs = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; await req.subscriptions.all(of: user).&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; messages = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; await req.messages.latestSubscribed(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;: subs).&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;()

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I migrated my &lt;code&gt;SubscriptionRepository&lt;/code&gt;, I could even get rid of the trailing &lt;code&gt;.get()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we could completely remove the empty &lt;code&gt;req.eventLoop.future()&lt;/code&gt;. A simple, blank &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement is enough. And creating models doesn&amp;rsquo;t force us anymore to nest everything one level deeper. We &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; the result, but we discard it.&lt;/p&gt;

I created two admin users, set up a group for homebrew and set the permissions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly this didn&amp;rsquo;t work out in the long run. So I started to run Homebrew as my preferred admin user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;whoami&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; !&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;vknabel&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; sudo -S --login -u vknabel bash -- &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;which brew&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$@&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; brew &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$@&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach worked and was muich more reliable than the previous approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Flutter. I had to add additional permissions and eventually change their ownership from time to time as flutter messed them up.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Converting simple iOS apps to tvOS is easy!</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/2021-08-02-converting-simple-ios-apps-to-tvos-is-easy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/2021-08-02-converting-simple-ios-apps-to-tvos-is-easy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Converting a simple and small iOS app was far easier than expected.

Beside the obvious cases like iOS Development, managing certificates and provisioning profiles, there was one big case left: Writing unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With perfect TDD (unit tests first, then code) this is no real problem, but if you want to write tests for already existing code, it is essential to get feedback about your current progress and test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these situations, I still opened Xcode, to check the coverage. As I did this too regular and missed my VS Code setup, I decided to give code coverage in VS Code a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-Coverage-for-VS-Code/example-xcode.png" alt="Code Coverage in Xcode"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research, I mostly found code coverage extensions for JS or other languages. Though I never found an extension supporting the llvm-cov-format produced by &lt;code&gt;swift test --enable-code-coverage&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;.build/*/debug/codecov/*.json&lt;/code&gt; out of the box. There are solutions like converting this coverage file to &lt;code&gt;lcov.info&lt;/code&gt;, but this would always require some setup in every project. So I started my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I really liked the idea of other extensions to highlight the code itself, I decided to adopt this idea. Though many highlight covered code using a green background, which feels too heavy for always being activated. So I decided to only highlight covered expressions by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-Coverage-for-VS-Code/example-vscode.png" alt="Code Coverage in VS Code with Swift Coverage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, install &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.swift-coverage"&gt;Swift Coverage - Visual Studio Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; and run your tests using &lt;code&gt;swift test --enable-code-coverage&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you need to update your coverage statistics, simple re-run your tests.
That&amp;rsquo;s it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you using &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment"&gt;Maintained Swift Development Environment&lt;/a&gt;?
To keep your coverage always up to date set &lt;code&gt;sde.swiftBuildingParams&lt;/code&gt; setting to &lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;--enable-code-coverage&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; to run all your unit tests on every change. Might not be a good idea with a slow test suite, but in smaller projects, this is super great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there something you are missing for Swift and VS Code?

Later I upgraded the young project to Vapor 4, but found some lack of practical information about the upgrade on the internet. So here I share my subjective experience and try to give you some tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app itself is relatively simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has user authentication and registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;users don‘t have any profile and cannot interact with each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on certain events, we notify multiple users on all of their devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;users have their personal list of notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, when most parts of the MVP were finished, I wanted to add &lt;a href="https://github.com/vapor/apns"&gt;vapor/apns&lt;/a&gt;, which required the new Vapor 4. But hasn’t Vapor 4 been released recently? Yes, but it seems like the Vapor team probably decided to keep Vapor 3 the default until the documentation and all surrounding has been finished (which is a good thing!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/whats-new-in-vapor-4/31832"&gt;list of changes&lt;/a&gt; reads nicely, new services API, new model API built on top of property wrappers looks gorgeous, synchronously decoding contents improves controllers far more than you might expect and eager loading is great to tune up performance and to even reduce the amount of nested futures to be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned I was especially interested in APNS. Additionally I need background jobs, which come as &lt;a href="https://github.com/vapor/queues"&gt;vapor/queues&lt;/a&gt; , too.
For me the decision was an obvious one: let‘s upgrade the code base!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="starting-the-migration-from-vapor-3-to-vapor-4"&gt;Starting the Migration from Vapor 3 to Vapor 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, the server had only 4 controllers, 10 routes, 13 request_response structs_enums, 6 models, only empty migrations, zero services and zero repositories. It was still using an SQLite in-memory database with SQLite imports and types spread across the whole project. Also it obviously didn‘t send any Push Notifications (although they were already stored).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a first step to upgrade Vapor, I head over to their &lt;a href="https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/upgrading/"&gt;Upgrading Docs&lt;/a&gt; and started with updating the Package.swift manifest dependencies and platforms as proposed. Apparently I could even drop the vapor/auth dependency as it is now included in Vapor 4. You might stumble upon &lt;code&gt;platforms: [.macOS(.v10_15)]&lt;/code&gt;: no worries, it still supports Linux. 👍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="configure"&gt;Configure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I copied the new proposed contents of &lt;code&gt;Sources/Run/main.swift&lt;/code&gt;, deleted &lt;code&gt;Sources/App/app.swift&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Sources/App/boot.swift&lt;/code&gt; (it was still empty) and changed &lt;code&gt;configure(_:_:_:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;routes(_:_:)&lt;/code&gt; to be of type &lt;code&gt;(Application) throws -&amp;gt; Void&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I already touched &lt;code&gt;configure(_:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;routes(_:)&lt;/code&gt;, I wanted to make those two files compile first, before moving to the next files, but the upgrading docs didn‘t really serve me well here. After some time reading through docs, I decided to generate a new Vapor 4 reference project using &lt;code&gt;vapor-beta new Example&lt;/code&gt; which used &lt;a href="https://github.com/vapor/template"&gt;vapor/template&lt;/a&gt; as template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing &lt;a href="https://github.com/vapor/api-template/blob/master/Sources/App/configure.swift"&gt;Vapor 3 api-template configure.swift&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/vapor/template/blob/master/Sources/App/configure.swift"&gt;new one&lt;/a&gt; I came to the conclusion, I could drop the most code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vapor 3 we usually started creating a &lt;code&gt;XxxConfig&lt;/code&gt; where we added types of migrations or used middlewares or databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Vapor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Fluent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;FluentSQLite&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; config: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;inout&lt;/span&gt; Config, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; env: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;inout&lt;/span&gt; Environment, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; services: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;inout&lt;/span&gt; Services) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Register providers first&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; services.register(FluentSQLiteProvider())
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Register routes to the router&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; router = EngineRouter.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; routes(router)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	services.register(router, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;: Router.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Configure a SQLite database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; sqlite = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; SQLiteDatabase(storage: .memory)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Register the configured SQLite database to the database config.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; databases = DatabasesConfig()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	databases.add(database: sqlite, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;: .sqlite)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	services.register(databases)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Register middleware&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; middlewares = MiddlewareConfig()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	middlewares.use(ErrorMiddleware.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	services.register(middlewares)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Register migrations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; migrations = MigrationConfig()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	migrations.add(model: User.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;, database: .sqlite) &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Note: it‘s a type!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	services.register(migrations)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Vapor 4, we just add instances of those types to &lt;code&gt;app.xxx&lt;/code&gt; directly instead. Much more readable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Vapor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Fluent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;FluentSQLiteDriver&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; app: Application) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; app.databases.use(.sqlite(.memory), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;: DatabaseID.sqlite)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	app.middleware.use(ErrorMiddleware.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;(environment: app.environment))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	app.migrations.add(CreateUser()) &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Note: here it‘s an instance!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; routes(app)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now our &lt;code&gt;configure.swift&lt;/code&gt; should only complain about our migrations, so let‘s head over to fix those!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="models"&gt;Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can fix our migrations, we should upgrade our models! For this step, it’s best to start bottom up from your simplest models to your most complex ones with lots of relations. Be patient and do one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is our example model in Vapor 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Vapor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;FluentSQLite&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;DeviceToken&lt;/span&gt;: SQLiteModel {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;typealias&lt;/span&gt; Database = SQLiteDatabase
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; createdAtKey: TimestampKey? = &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.createdAt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; id: Int? &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Note the Int? As id!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; value: String
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; userID: User.ID
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; createdAt: Date?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; user: Parent&amp;lt;DeviceToken, User&amp;gt; { parent(&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.userID) }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;(id: Int? = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;, value: String, user: User) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.id = id
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.value = value
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		 &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.userID = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; user.requireID()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here is the interesting part: our new Vapor 4 variant of &lt;code&gt;DeviceToken&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Fluent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;DeviceToken&lt;/span&gt;: Model {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; schema = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;device_tokens&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	@ID(key: .id) &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; id: Int?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	@Field(key: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;value&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; value: String
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	@Parent(key: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;user_id&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; user: User
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	@Timestamp(key: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;created_at&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, on: .create) &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; createdAt: Date?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;() {} &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 7 this is required, but in my case always empty ^^&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;(id: UUID? = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;, value: String, user: User) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.id = id
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.value = value
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// ATTENTION: using self.user = user crashes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;user.id = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; user.requireID()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;user.value = user
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite a lot to explain here, although it should be rather straight-forward. Essentially we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drop the fluent database import&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replace the database typealias with the name of our schema (e.g. table name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add the &lt;code&gt;@ID(key: .id)&lt;/code&gt; property wrapper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mark every field with &lt;code&gt;@Field(key: &amp;quot;name_of_field_in_schema&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; (giving the column name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;declare the parent
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove old &lt;code&gt;var userID: User.ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replace old computed &lt;code&gt;var user: Parent&amp;lt;DeviceToken, User&amp;gt; { parent(\.userID) }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with &lt;code&gt;@Parent(key: &amp;quot;user_id&amp;quot;) var user: User&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same rules apply to children and siblings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of declaring static &lt;code&gt;createdAtKey&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;updatedAtKey&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;deletedAtKey&lt;/code&gt; use &lt;code&gt;@Timestamp(key: FieldKey, on: TimestampTrigger)&lt;/code&gt; as seen above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add an empty &lt;code&gt;init() {}&lt;/code&gt;. Not sure when to customize and what its for 🤔&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here you need to pay attention! You may never set your relations directly, always use &lt;code&gt;$user.value =&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$user.id =&lt;/code&gt;. In this case we set both resulting in an already eager loaded &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if your models conform to &lt;code&gt;Parameter&lt;/code&gt;: just remove it. It has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="migrations"&gt;Migrations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our models are fine now, let’s dive into their migrations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously it was a common practice to conform your models to &lt;code&gt;Migration&lt;/code&gt; and to even let Fluent derive a default migration from your &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt;. Though with Vapor 4 we need to actually implement those. I mean, conforming your models to migration isn‘t scalable anyways. So after all it‘s a good change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am generally a fan of doing just one single change at a time, I think this a great opportunity to move your migrations into separate files inside a &lt;code&gt;Migrations&lt;/code&gt; folder, if they are still in the same file as their models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all I know, your existing migrations will break, but they should be rather easy to migrate. Anyways I didn‘t have real migrations, just the default ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Fluent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;DeviceToken&lt;/span&gt;: Migration { }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Alternatively manual migrations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;FluentPostgreSQL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Domain&lt;/span&gt;: Migration {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;prepare&lt;/span&gt;(on conn: PostgreSQLConnection) -&amp;gt; Future&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; PostgreSQLDatabase.create(DeviceToken.&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;, on: conn) { builder &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; builder.field(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.id, isIdentifier: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; builder.field(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.value)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; builder.field(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.userID)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; builder.reference(from: &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.userID, to: &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;User.id)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;			 builder.field(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.createdAt)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;			 builder.unique(on: &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.value)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some personal note:&lt;/strong&gt; I prefer to use the actual relation entities the in initializers. That way I have compiler guarantees, that their id actually exist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let‘s get our hands dirty and write some migrations in Vapor 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Fluent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Note: we don‘t have to specify the database type!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;CreateDeviceToken&lt;/span&gt;: Migration {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;prepare&lt;/span&gt;(on: database: Database) -&amp;gt; EventLoopFuture&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; database.schema(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;device_tokens&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;			.id() &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &amp;lt;- oops! This is always .uuid, not .int which is not available on SQLite&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;			.field(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;value&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, .string, .&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;			.field(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;user_id&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, .uuid, .&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;, .references(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;users&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;id“))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;			.field(&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;created_at&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;, .datetime, .required)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;			.unique(on: &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;			.create()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;	func revert(on database: Database) -&amp;gt; EventLoopFuture&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;		return database.schema(&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;device_tokens&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;).delete()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, we notice much more strings than key paths and that all migrations have to rewritten! Though the upgrade should be comparably easy. If you have a lot migrations, you might have a though job as &lt;code&gt;revert(on:)&lt;/code&gt; is mandatory now. Hopefully we will never need to revert any migrations in production!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note: I was using SQLite, but the &lt;code&gt;.id()&lt;/code&gt;-shorthand is hard-coded to use type &lt;code&gt;.uuid&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// From Fluent’s source code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;SchemaBuilder&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;() -&amp;gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; 		&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;.field(.id, .uuid, .identifier(auto: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the models and migrations were already independent of the database technology, I decided to switch from SQLite to Postgres, especially as models are now independent of the underlaying database (you import &lt;code&gt;Fluent&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Fluent{Database}&lt;/code&gt;), this change was quite easy and did only affect &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;configure.swift&lt;/code&gt;. If you don‘t, you probably need to use &lt;code&gt;.field(.id, .int, .identifier(auto: true))&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;.id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t use any authentication, &lt;code&gt;configure.swift&lt;/code&gt;, all your models and migrations should compile without any errors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="authentication"&gt;Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I didn’t tune my current authentication implementation, I tried to stick as close as possible to the new &lt;a href="https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/authentication/"&gt;Vapor: Security → Authentication&lt;/a&gt; docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the app will have a password less login, I didn’t use any basic authentication, which is therefore missing below. But according to the docs, it should be relatively easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; Vapor 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Vapor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Authentication&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;: TokenAuthenticatable {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;/// Allows this model to be used as a TokenAuthenticatable’s token.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;UserToken&lt;/span&gt;: Token {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;/// See `Token`.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;typealias&lt;/span&gt; UserType = User
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;/// See `Token`.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; tokenKey: WritableKeyPath&amp;lt;UserToken, String&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.string
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;/// See `Token`.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; userIDKey: WritableKeyPath&amp;lt;UserToken, User.ID&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;.userID
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually upgrading this, took me some time, since parts of the logic are now reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;Vapor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;: Authenticatable {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;generateToken&lt;/span&gt;() &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;gt; UserToken {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; UserToken(
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; value: [UInt8].random(count: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;).base64,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; user: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; )
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;UserToken&lt;/span&gt;: ModelTokenAuthenticatable {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; valueKey = &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;UserToken.&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;value
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; 	&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; userKey = &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;UserToken.&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;user
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; isValid: Bool {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 Date() &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; expiresAt ?? Date()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all: drop the Authentication import. Vapor is enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we mark &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;Authenticatable&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;TokenAuthenticatable&lt;/code&gt;. This allows you to decode it in your controllers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essentially we moved the static &lt;code&gt;UserToken.create&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;User.generateToken&lt;/code&gt; and updated it to use Swift’s latest APIs. Completely optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old &lt;code&gt;Token&lt;/code&gt; protocol will be replaced by &lt;code&gt;ModelTokenAuthenticatable&lt;/code&gt; where we get rid of the &lt;code&gt;UserType&lt;/code&gt;-typealias and rename the static constants for key paths. And we prefix them with &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; to select the field property wrappers instead of their values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The docs proposed &lt;code&gt;isValid&lt;/code&gt; to always be &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, though as I kept &lt;code&gt;expiredAt&lt;/code&gt;, I chose a real implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, your models, migrations and your configure should be free from errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some small changes in your routes and we can put a check at authentication. Though as these are very well documented and highly specific to your application, I’ll keep this short!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; bearer = router.grouped(User.tokenAuthMiddleware())
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;MARK:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt; - Vapor 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; bearer = app.grouped(UserToken.authenticator()) &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// note the UserToken instead of User&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="services-and-repositories"&gt;Services and Repositories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I didn’t use services and repositories yet, I have no more detailed help for you, but from reading the appropriate upgrading chapters &lt;a href="https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/upgrading/#services"&gt;Upgrading Services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/upgrading/#repositories"&gt;Upgrading Repositories&lt;/a&gt;, it should be straightforward anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="routes-and-controllers-learnings"&gt;Routes and Controllers, Learnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now only routes and controllers should be left. As routes and controllers are tied together, I both simultaneously. One route and method at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I won’t provide lots of actual code diffs as above, because even the list of all subtle changes is impressive and far from complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instead of &lt;code&gt;Model.parameter&lt;/code&gt; in your routes name it &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;:model_id&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, in your controller replace &lt;code&gt;req.parameters.next(_:)&lt;/code&gt;with &lt;code&gt;Model.find(req.parameters.get(&amp;quot;model_id&amp;quot;), on: req.db)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you have route components with a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; inside, split them up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are less extensions on &lt;code&gt;req&lt;/code&gt;, but more vars
_ Use &lt;code&gt;req.auth.require(_:)&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;req.requireAuthenticated(_:)&lt;/code&gt;
_ &lt;code&gt;DeviceToken.query(on: req.db)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;req.content.decode(_:)&lt;/code&gt; is now synchronous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In queries, your key paths should end with fields (just share some $)
_ &lt;code&gt;.filter(\.$token == deviceToken)&lt;/code&gt;_&lt;code&gt;.filter(\.$user.$id == user.id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.save(on:)&lt;/code&gt; now returns &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt;
_ either add a new func &lt;code&gt;saveAndReturn(on database: Database) -&amp;gt; EventLoopFuture&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt;
_ or use &lt;code&gt;x.save(on: req.db).transform(to: x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Async
_ &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt; may not throw anymore (you can temporarily add overloads marked as &lt;code&gt;@available(_, deprecated)&lt;/code&gt;to get warnings) * there is no global&lt;code&gt;flatMap(_:_:)&lt;/code&gt;anymore, instead use&lt;code&gt;.and(_:).flatMap(_:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relations
_ direct access of relations like &lt;code&gt;token.user&lt;/code&gt; crashes if not loaded eagerly using &lt;code&gt;.with(\.$user)&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;QueryBuilder&amp;lt;Model&amp;gt;.with(_:KeyPath&amp;lt;Self, Relation&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;) _ for save, synchronous access use&lt;code&gt;token.$user.value?&lt;/code&gt;or for async access&lt;code&gt;token.$user.get(on:)&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;.query(on:)&lt;/code&gt;_ directly setting&lt;code&gt;token.user =&lt;/code&gt;always fails; use&lt;code&gt;token.$user.value =&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;token.$user.id =&lt;/code&gt;_ when setting&lt;code&gt;token.$user.value =&lt;/code&gt;, it does not update&lt;code&gt;token.$user.id&lt;/code&gt;! You need to do both, but then your data has been loaded eagerly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-to-go-from-here"&gt;Where to go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of your server should be migrated. What’s missing are view renderers, your tests (though they should not break) and more advanced feature. But most effort should be finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in my small application, the upgrade required a reasonable amount of work, though it was mostly about diffing existing code and documentation. On the other hand the Vapor team did a great job to produce compile errors instead of runtime errors!
As someone who upgraded several large single page web apps, this was a bless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did this help you? Have you found a bug? What was your upgrade like? Let’s have a chat on &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@vknabel"&gt;@mastodon.social@vknabel&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vknabel.github.io/issues/new"&gt;open an issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Swift, VS Code and you</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/swift-vs-code-and-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/swift-vs-code-and-you/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Editors like Visual Studio Code live from a wide range of extensions and customization. In contrast there are IDEs like Xcode and AppCode, which have everything set up and are ready to go. In order to provide a rich set of features, they cannot not offer the same level of flexibility. Which editor you might want to use is a highly personal decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; I am the maintainer of the extensions &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swift-development-environment"&gt;Maintained Swift Development Environment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.github.com/vknabel/sourcekite"&gt;sourcekite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swiftlint"&gt;SwiftLint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swiftformat"&gt;SwiftFormat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-apple-swift-format"&gt;apple-swift-format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="autocompletion"&gt;Autocompletion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Visual Studio Code ships with basic syntax highlighting, it won’t give you any suggestions or diagnostics. In order to get autocompletion working, you have two major possibilities:
Using &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp"&gt;Apple’s official VS Code extension&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swift-development-environment"&gt;Maintained Swift Development Environment&lt;/a&gt; (or in short SDE). Apple’s extension needs to be compiled manually with Node JS, SDE has already been published to the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDE supports two underlaying drivers: Apple’s SourceKit LSP and its own Sourcekite, while Apple does not. Support thee same degree of freedom.
If you are not sure install SDE and try both drivers out. Stick with the one that fits your needs best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sourcekit-lsp-in-action"&gt;sourcekit-lsp in action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment of writing, &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp"&gt;sourcekit-lsp&lt;/a&gt; is more reliable in autocompletion. And as it’s Apple’s official implementation, it will further improve on the long term.
It does only support Swift Package Manager projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-VS-Code-and-you/SDE-sourcekit-lsp.gif" alt="SDE with sourcekit-lsp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sourcekite-in-action"&gt;sourcekite in action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekite"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sourcekite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; works out of the box with Swift Package Manager projects, too. Additionally you can manually configure your project structure to support standalone files, Xcode projects, Tensorflow or UIKit projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-VS-Code-and-you/SDE-sourcekite.gif" alt="SDE with sourcekite"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="debugging"&gt;Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every piece of code needs to be tested and debugged. In contrast to Xcode, you need to manually configure your debugging targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this purpose use LLDB Debugger. In case you need more details, read my blog post on &lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/pages/Debugging-Swift-in-VS-Code/"&gt;Debugging Swift in VS Code | Valentin Knabel&lt;/a&gt;. On Linux you might need some additional setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-VS-Code-and-you/LLDB.png" alt="LLDB Debugger"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="swiftlint"&gt;SwiftLint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably know SwiftLint. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great to see all its warnings and errors in VS Code? It is with &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swiftlint"&gt;SwiftLint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you need to install &lt;a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation"&gt;SwiftLint&lt;/a&gt; manually. If you add SwiftLint as dependency to your Swift Package Manager project, the extension will prefer the local version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-VS-Code-and-you/Swiftlint.png" alt="SwiftLint"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="swiftformat"&gt;SwiftFormat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like code formatters, you have two options.
First &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swiftformat"&gt;SwiftFormat&lt;/a&gt; which uses &lt;a href="https://www.github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat"&gt;nicklockwood/SwiftFormat&lt;/a&gt; under the hood and second &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-apple-swift-format"&gt;apple-swift-format&lt;/a&gt; which relies on &lt;a href="https://www.github.com/apple/swift-format"&gt;apple/swift-format&lt;/a&gt;.
Pick the used extension for your project&amp;rsquo;s tool to avoid unnecessary reformats and merge conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, you need to install the command line tools manually: either &lt;a href="https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#command-line-tool"&gt;nicklockwood/SwiftFormat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-format#swift-format"&gt;apple/swift-format&lt;/a&gt;.
In both cases: if you add the formatter of your choice as dependency to your Swift Package Manager project, the extension will prefer the local version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: enable &lt;code&gt;editor.formatOnSave&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-VS-Code-and-you/swift-format.gif" alt="SwiftFormat"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="templating"&gt;Templating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of tooling built on top of templating languages like Stencil of Leaf. Of course there are some extensions for these languages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svanimpe.stencil"&gt;Stencil&lt;/a&gt; for VS Code if you are using Sourcery or Kitura. No additional dependencies are are required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-VS-Code-and-you/Stencil.png" alt="Stencil"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vapor users may be interested in &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Francisco.html-leaf"&gt;Leaf HTML&lt;/a&gt; for VS Code. Nothing to install here either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://vknabel.com/images/Swift-VS-Code-and-you/Leaf.png" alt="Leaf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-left"&gt;What’s left&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general there are many features missing when using VS Code for Swift development.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of all features missing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Xcode project support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Playground support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No iOS debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No refactoring, yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Swift migrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing debugger snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing tasks and commands for SPM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incomplete Language Servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual installation of dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convenience plugins for external Tooling (Mint, Sourcery, Rocket, &amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about you? Have you already tried different editors?
Do you know any additional extensions or have any questions?
Let&amp;rsquo;s get in touch on &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@vknabel"&gt;@mastodon.social@vknabel&lt;/a&gt; or via &lt;a href="mailto:swift-vscode-and-you@vknabel.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Debugging Swift in VS Code the old way</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/debugging-swift-in-vs-code/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/debugging-swift-in-vs-code/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Running and debugging your targets in Visual Studio Code is not prepared by default. Especially for us Swift developers this might come unexpected, especially in comparison to Xcode.
In VS Code we require extensions and configs for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update from 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; the Swift Server Work Group released their own &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang"&gt;official VS Code extension&lt;/a&gt; which dramatically improves the debugging user experience. &lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/pages/Debugging-Swift-in-VS-Code-in-2022/"&gt;Here is the new, updated blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this blog post, we will set up debugging for a Swift Package Manager project. As a bonus we will also prepare debugging your unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to install an extension as VS Code does not come with Swift debugger: &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb"&gt;LLDB Debugger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s create a new project on open it in VS Code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ swift package init --type executable
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating executable package: MyProject
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Package.swift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating README.md
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating .gitignore
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Sources/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Sources/MyProject/main.swift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Tests/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Tests/LinuxMain.swift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Tests/MyProjectTests/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Tests/MyProjectTests/MyProjectTests.swift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating Tests/MyProjectTests/XCTestManifests.swift
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ code . &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# if not found: open -a &amp;#34;Visual Studio Code&amp;#34; .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve prepared all prerequisites, we are ready to set up our first debugging target! In the debuggers tab in your vscode window, select the drop down and then &amp;ldquo;Add configuration&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. This will now create a new file called &lt;code&gt;.vscode/launch.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example configuration supporting running executable targets, unit tests on macOS and Linux. Relevant files will be compiled using the pre-launch-tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// .vscode/launch.json
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;version&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;0.2.0&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;configurations&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: [
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Running executables
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;lldb&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;request&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;launch&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;Run your Executable&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;program&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;${workspaceFolder}/.build/debug/your-executable&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;args&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: [],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;cwd&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;${workspaceFolder}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;preLaunchTask&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;swift-build&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Running unit tests
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;preLaunchTask&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;swift-build-tests&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;lldb&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;request&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;launch&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;Debug tests on Linux&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;program&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;./.build/x86_64-unknown-linux/debug/YourPackageTests.xctest&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;preLaunchTask&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;swift-build-tests&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; ]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here are the promised pre-launched-tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// .vscode/tasks.json

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// compile your SPM tests

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;group&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;build&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;&amp;#34;args&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: [
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;build&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;--build-tests&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// for TensorFlow add &amp;#34;-Xlinker&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;-ltensorflow&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; ]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; ]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly this approach currently does not work when debugging iOS or macOS apps, but Swift Package Manager projects and CLIs work great!
I hope you enjoy your increased productivity!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>InferIt: a Constraint Solving Package Manager</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/inferit-a-constraint-solving-package-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/inferit-a-constraint-solving-package-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The initial idea behind InferIt was to create some mixture of a constraint solver and a dependency manager: you would just tell it what to install and it would gather as much information as possible to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to fulfill a requirement. InferIt would then try to resolve all variables by trying to fulfill several requirements. If a requirement has been met, the value can be propagated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current example does not include side effects or file system lookups. Though this essentially is the key behind this idea and is possible for synchronous operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus I still believe this to be an interesting topic, the amount of variables and requirements seem to explode and to be hard to debug without any additional tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore this constraint solver still operates synchronously. To be production ready this needs to be implemented asynchrously, which would then enhance.&lt;/p&gt;

The new version 0.3.0 puts everything on steroids and allows you to script your metadata.
A detailed overview of all changes can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/Archery/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#021"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="archerfile-loaders"&gt;Archerfile Loaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first you will notice the new option to load additional contents into your Archerfile an incredibly open field of new possibilities.
The most obvious use case is to collect metadata from multiple configuration files.
At a second look you can even script the generation of your metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;loaders&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;cat Metadata/*.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; - &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;echo today: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;mirror file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vknabel/Archery/0.3.0/Examples/MapSwiftTargetsToScripts.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But caution: your loader will be executed with every invocation of Archery. Make sure they run fast enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sequence-of-scripts"&gt;Sequence of Scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often one script requires multiple steps. In earlier versions we used &lt;code&gt;vknabel/ArcheryArrow&lt;/code&gt; for this purpose. Now we can be much more direct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;: [&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;host, swift5.0, swift5.1]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;swift test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;swift5.0&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;docker ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;swift5.1&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;docker ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="environment-variables"&gt;Environment variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume we have &lt;code&gt;Metadata/Scripts.yml&lt;/code&gt; with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;dump&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;echo $ARCHERY_METADATA&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In here we use our second new feature: using env variables to access our Archerfile contents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On execution you will receive the fully loaded metadata as JSON!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this the whole underlying script execution mechanism has been rebuild from scratch.
Previously scripts relied on separate SwiftPM repositories, called Arrows, which would be installed by Archery using Mint. For many use cases this mechanism required too much ceremony around it. For example the &lt;code&gt;vknabel/BashArrow&lt;/code&gt; would have to be compiled before running your actual script.
Instead we focus on the easiest and fastest scripting mechanism: bash scripts.
Though this will not break: Archery will generate the correct Mint commands and will execute your arrows as before if you have Mint installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the speed up for bash scripts, the &lt;code&gt;vknabel/ArcheryArrow&lt;/code&gt; will come pre-shipped too and doesn‘t take a whole Swift build to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="faq-and-examples"&gt;FAQ and Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-update-to-030"&gt;How do I update to 0.3.0?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your existing Archerfile still works the same as before. So nothing to do on this side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you currently use the arrow syntax, make sure to have Mint installed as it moved from an internal to an external dependency. Also make sure to use Swift 5 as Swift 4 support has been dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="is-there-a-new-plugin-concept"&gt;Is there a new plugin concept?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously Mint was the only mechanism to implement plugins. Now as we focus on more general solutions, the new mechanism needs to be more general, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though more general problems require more solutions or even more specializations. Mint will still be available as any other command line tool. To fill the more general gap, I created &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/mirror-sh"&gt;Mirror&lt;/a&gt; which tries to solve similar problems on a more general basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-can-i-share-and-reuse-parts-of-my-metadata"&gt;How can I share and reuse parts of my metadata?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as you can script your metadata, you can also easily reuse parts of your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;loaders&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;mirror file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vknabel/Archery/0.3.0/Examples/TestingOnMultiplePlatforms.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example we used &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/mirror-sh"&gt;Mirror&lt;/a&gt; from above as &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; would always download the file over and over. Mirror does it only once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="project-bash"&gt;Project Bash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some larger projects might already require their own CLI. Smaller ones only have a few helpers around.
The following script exposes
Linking all scripts into your current bash session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# Archerfile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;node Scripts/alias.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Scripts/alias.js

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Object.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; .&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;((&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;alias&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; .&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;((&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;() {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt; &amp;#34;$@&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; });
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end we are capable of linking all helpers directly into our current bash or zsh session!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overriding data with Archery is quite easy: load the same data structure with different contents. If you wish some configs to be private, just put them into your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;loaders&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# load default configs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;cat Config.default.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;# override with private configs if existing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff"&gt;cat Config.private.yml 2&amp;gt; /dev/null&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the same mechanism you can even override a few scripts, e.g. if you prefer to dockerize your dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SDE 2.7.0 released</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/sde-2-7-0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/sde-2-7-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I released the new &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment/releases/tag/2.7.0"&gt;2.7.0 update to SDE for VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and the companion project sourcekite has been updated, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new sourcekite &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/sourcekite/releases/tag/0.5.0"&gt;0.5.0&lt;/a&gt; now supports Swift 5, but drops support for Swift 3. If you still need support for Swift 3.1, I also tagged &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/sourcekite/releases/tag/0.4.2"&gt;0.4.2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2.6.0, SDE already supported Apple‘s official &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp"&gt;sourcekit-lsp&lt;/a&gt; by using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;sde.languageServerMode&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;langserver&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;swift.languageServerPath&lt;/code&gt; setting.
As announced in &lt;a href="https://www.vknabel.com/pages/Apples-SourceKit-LSP-and-SDE-Roadmap/"&gt;Apples SourceKit-LSP and SDE Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; SDE 2.7.0 now explicitly mirrors official SourceKit-LSP settings like &lt;code&gt;sourcekit-lsp.serverPath&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sourcekit-lsp.toolchainPath&lt;/code&gt;. These settings will only be respected when explicitly setting &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;sde.languageServerMode&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;sourcekit-lsp&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‘d suggest you to configure both &lt;code&gt;sourcekit-lsp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sourcekite&lt;/code&gt; configs. Depending on your project, you may swap out the actually used LSP by updating &lt;code&gt;sde.languageServerMode&lt;/code&gt;. Both LSP implementations have different benefits. Apple‘s SourceKit-LSP is easier to install, under active development and more robust. On the other hand SDE‘s LSP is more flexible in terms of settings, works for standalone Swift files, Xcode projects (through manual configuration) and handles modules differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upgrade-if-you-use-sourcekit-lsp"&gt;Upgrade if you use SourceKit-LSP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your settings replace your &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;sde.languageServerMode&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;langserver&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;sde.languageServerMode&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;sourcekit-lsp&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;swift.languageServerPath&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;sourcekit-lsp.serverPath&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‘s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upgrade-if-you-use-sourcekite"&gt;Upgrade if you use Sourcekite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone the latest version of sourcekite and open the repo within your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Linux:&lt;/strong&gt; assuming you have already linked your &lt;code&gt;sourcekitdInProc&lt;/code&gt;, you simply need to run &lt;code&gt;swift build -Xlinker -l:sourcekitdInProc -c release&lt;/code&gt; and overwrite your old binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On macOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Run &lt;code&gt;make install LIB_DIR=/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest.xctoolchain/usr/lib&lt;/code&gt; if you have multiple Swift toolchains installed and &lt;code&gt;make install LIB_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib&lt;/code&gt; otherwise to install the new build to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/sourcekite&lt;/code&gt;. If you used a different path, override it by adding &lt;code&gt;PREFIX=&amp;lt;your-path&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;swift.path.sourcekite&lt;/code&gt; should still be valid. Make sure to restart your VS Code before further development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upgrade-if-you-use-ryan-loveletts-langserverswift"&gt;Upgrade if you use Ryan Lovelett‘s LangserverSwift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have no upgrade steps to do, but you are now able to additionally use SourceKit-LSP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install SourceKit-LSP and let the global &lt;code&gt;sourcekit-lsp.serverPath&lt;/code&gt; point to the release binary. Now you can swap your language server inside different projects by overriding &lt;code&gt;sde.languageServerMode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though as Ryan‘s Langserver is no longer maintained, I‘d recommend you to set your default &lt;code&gt;sde.languageServerMode&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;sourcekite&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sourcekit-lsp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Apple’s SourceKit LSP and SDE Roadmap</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/apples-sourcekit-lsp-and-sde-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/apples-sourcekit-lsp-and-sde-roadmap/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Apple recently &lt;a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/new-lsp-language-service-supporting-swift-and-c-family-languages-for-any-editor-and-platform/17024/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; to develop a language server for Swift and C-family languages. Or said more clearly: Apple started development to support every editor implementing the &lt;a href="https://langserver.org/"&gt;language server protocol&lt;/a&gt; like VS Code, Sublime Text, Jet Brains‘ IDEs and Atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later they published the &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp"&gt;source code in GitHub &lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/tree/master/Editors"&gt;support for VS Code and Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;. It will work on Linux but is currently limited to Swift snapshots and the VS Code extension hasn’t been published yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really love Apple’s decision to take over this responsibility. I think they will be able do a much better job than we as a community have done so far. There were quite a few LSPs for Swift, AFAIK all of them started as an experiment. Most of them got stuck at Swift 3.x and never supported Swift 4. &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment"&gt;SDE for VS Code&lt;/a&gt; was one of them until I started maintaining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-future-of-sde"&gt;The future of SDE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I feel responsible to inform users (and potential ones) about my plans regarding SDE. TL;DR I will still continue to maintain SDE and fix issues if I can. And, of course, I‘d be happy for any feedback and bug reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe Apple‘s SourceKit LSP will be the way to go once it is stable and supports stable Swift releases. My future goal for SDE is to smoothly prepare the transition to it and Apple’s still unpublished VS Code extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As SDE comes with its own LSP implementation, I already released &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment/releases/tag/2.6.0"&gt;SDE 2.6.0&lt;/a&gt; to support alternative language server implementations like &lt;a href="https://github.com/RLovelett/langserver-swift"&gt;RLovelett‘s LangserverSwift&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s (back then: unpublished) SourceKit LSP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following roadmap isn’t final and may actually differ:
At first I will mirror all &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/blob/master/Editors/vscode/package.json"&gt;settings of the VS Code extension&lt;/a&gt; as it reduces barriers and migration issues. &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment/issues/39"&gt;#39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the extension has been released to VS Code‘s extension registry and it is stable enough, I will add a warning to prefer that instead if not installed yet. &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment/issues/40"&gt;#40&lt;/a&gt; If it has been installed and activated, SDE will disable itself automatically. &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment/issues/41"&gt;#41&lt;/a&gt; These options should be opt-out. The goal within this phase is to decide which extension to use within which project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I don’t see any reason to keep maintaining SDE, I will add a message as explanation. If SDE will still have features which are not part of Apple’s extension, I will extract them into separate extensions which will still be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you agree with these future plans. If you have more ideas, feedback or if your don’t agree on this, please &lt;a href="https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment/issues/new"&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; or tell me on &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@vknabel"&gt;@mastodon.social@vknabel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CommandMine</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/commandmine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/commandmine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Command mine is a concept of a swift library for parsing command line arguments. It is designed to support asynchronous implementations of CLIS, that may even be used inside frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="definitions"&gt;Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CommandMine is about extracting minerals out of your ore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; goldmine = Mine&amp;lt;Gold&amp;gt;() &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// declare your mine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; .drift( &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// One way to get to your gold&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; named: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;init&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; digging drift: Drift, &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// Prepares your Shaft&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; to shaft: execute &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;// your actual program&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; )
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="shaft"&gt;Shaft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A protocol describing factories of &lt;em&gt;Rails&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mine"&gt;Mine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your program. Is a Shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="drift"&gt;Drift&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special form of a Shaft, that parses raw ore (&lt;code&gt;[String]&lt;/code&gt;) into minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ore"&gt;Ore&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arguments passed to your program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lore"&gt;Lore&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An event wrapper around minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mineral"&gt;Mineral&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desired mineral of your mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rail"&gt;Rail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transports your filled Lores.
A simple typealias for &lt;em&gt;Observables&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Lores&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="elevator"&gt;Elevator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fastest connection to the outside. A Rx wrapper around print and read line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the elevator is to make your CLI embeddable as library without any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; ele = Elevator&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ele.onNext(.error(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)) &lt;span style="color:#75715e"&gt;//.success(&amp;#34;&amp;#34;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elevator.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="reusability"&gt;Reusability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CommandMine tries to keep your CLIs independent from STDIO and may be used asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally it is important to keep parts of your code reusable and replaceable: your CLI may evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="framework-support"&gt;Framework Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to internal or higher level tooling, frameworks suite better than plain CLIs as it eliminates the need to deal with another binary in your path, that your users need to install and keep up to date. Instead it will be compiled within your own target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to split your project into a framework and CLI, you just declare your mine and drifts in &lt;code&gt;YourMine&lt;/code&gt;, everything else in &lt;code&gt;YourShaft&lt;/code&gt; and in your executable&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;main.swift&lt;/code&gt; you just start your mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hint:&lt;/em&gt; you can create this project layout with &lt;code&gt;mine init&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;YourMine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;yourMine.runMain()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;YourShaft&lt;/code&gt; will be good for everyone who either wants to provide a complete new CLI using your logic, or for non CLIs.
At first exporting your mine and drifts into &lt;code&gt;YourMine&lt;/code&gt; seems awkward, but it may actually help others to embed your project as a subcommand (after all Mines are just complex Shafts) or to just reuse one drift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mine&lt;/code&gt;: your CLIs, tasks arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Drift&lt;/code&gt;: parses arguments for Shaft, sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Cage&lt;/code&gt;: the options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shaft&lt;/code&gt;: a command, async&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Elevator&lt;/code&gt;: user feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Drift&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; Factory that emits one single &lt;code&gt;Lore&lt;/code&gt; or an error with its help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;CommandMine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; main = Shaft(named: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;rock&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, summary: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; .drift(named: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;init&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, explainedBy: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;&amp;#34;Creates a new project&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) { (cage: EmptyLore) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; initObsi
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;main.run { result &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; result {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; }

&lt;p&gt;An alternative concept for modeling CLIs in Swift is &lt;a href="https://vknabel.com/pages/ArgumentOverture"&gt;ArgumentOverture&lt;/a&gt;, which would have much less impact on the actual program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept is probably too big and hard to adapt for the benefit it will provide. Though the name is quite nice. 😅&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why I created Rock for Swift CLIs</title><link>https://vknabel.com/posts/why-i-created-rock-for-swift-clis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vknabel.com/posts/why-i-created-rock-for-swift-clis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I excessively make use of the official Swift Package Manager as I usually do some CLIs or other stuff. For this use case it is really great. When developing Apps, Carthage and CocoaPods come in handy, which are great, too.
For Web Development there are yarn and NPM, which support project based and global installs. Then there are gem (global) and bundler (project) for ruby based dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I missed was an easy way of distribution for Swift CLIs for either projects or globally. Homebrew is great and can handle global installs great, but for some projects the overhead of submitting new formulas seems too high, especially as this has to be a contribution of a user, not its developer, which is exactly the behavior you want for your personal environment.
Furthermore it is not meant to pin certain versions of your dependencies. You simply can&amp;rsquo;t install one dependency in different versions just for some projects you&amp;rsquo;re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly this is the reason why we have Swiftenv, RVM, pyenv, Bundler and much more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you ensure your whole team uses the same dependency versions?
You must declare it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Swift CLI dependencies there is no such system yet.
And that has been the reason why I created Rock for the Swift Ecosystem.
I want everyone to be able to submit their own projects (like CocoaPods) but support decentralized (and private) architectures, too (like Carthage and SwiftPM).
Therefore Rock only focuses on Swift CLIs has been built to work seamlessly with Swift Package Manager projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the same or other problems? Do you have a different opinion?
I would be really happy to receive some feedback from you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
