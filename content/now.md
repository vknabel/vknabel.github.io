title: "Now"
---

Currently I mostly do some Homelab stuff, riding my bicyle and enjoying my life in general.

- By day I work as a Kubernetes and Go Engineer at [x-cellent](https://x-cellent.com/). You might even spot me on their website, too.
- By night I mostly tinker with my Homelab.
- If the weather is great there is a high chance I am riding my bicycle _right now_.
- During rain, [books](/library) are great!
- Trying to break 5.5k by bicycle.
