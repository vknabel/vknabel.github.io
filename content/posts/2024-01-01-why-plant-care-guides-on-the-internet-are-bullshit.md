There are already many websites offering plant care tips. The articles tend to be very long but contain little relevant information.

Almost every plant is described as needing bright, indirect light and as being unable to tolerate root rot or requiring fertilisation in winter. It's as if there are plants that like to rot away! It is often stated that houseplants need increased humidity. By how much? 50%? 80%? The exact specification is often missing.

Oh, and by the way... This beautiful plant is the perfect starter plant for you. It only costs $50 and will attract spider mites if it is not cared for properly. Completely altruistic, of course. Shops and websites with affiliate links or advertising are simply not reliable or independent sources.

## What matters?

Every plant is unique and grows in a unique environment: yours. Every tip for caring for a plant comes from someone with different watering habits, substrate and lighting conditions. Humidity, air circulation, temperature and fertilisation can all be different, too. Even the water probably has a completely different hardness level.

This makes it impossible to make suggestions that are applicable everywhere—or that make sense. That's why you see the same information everywhere. Nevertheless, there are differences. These must be pointed out.

## How we're different

Rather than resorting to the same old clichés, we compare different plants and assume that you already have some. No bullshit.

Read our care tips for anthuriums and compare them with other arum plants, such as alocasias and philodendrons. We also provide profiles or portraits of individual species for comparison.

For example, let's compare [Anthurium gracile](/posts/2024-01-31-anthurium-gracile-care-and-propagation/) with other anthuriums. If you already have experience of caring for anthuriums, we only need to briefly address their special features. This will also give you a quick overview of the plant.

Most species grow differently and can be displayed in various ways. If a plant has an unusual growth habit, we will mention that, too.

We only write about our own plants, not random or trendy ones. If the plant has a yellow leaf, this will be included in the photo. There will be content about common plants, as well as lesser-known plants and individual hybrids.
