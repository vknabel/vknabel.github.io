The Syngonium Wendlandii is truly something special. With its deep green, velvety leaves, a silver stripe in the middle, and a relatively compact size, it sets itself apart from its counterparts.

As an alternative, there is also the Syngonium Rayii, which, however, requires higher humidity but rewards with significantly darker leaves.

The leaves themselves feel slightly velvety but also somewhat firmer. In the juvenile form, the leaves are arrow-shaped, and with age, the earlobes separate, transforming the leaf into three parts. This is not unusual for Syngoniums – here, it happens faster and more straightforwardly. However, with increasing leaf size, the silver color diminishes and thins out.
The juvenile leaves are arrow-shaped, as in other young Syngoniums.
The adult leaves are three-parted.

## Care

With few exceptions, Syngoniums are straightforward and have no special requirements for humidity. This holds true for Wendlandii, despite its velvety leaves. Although the leaves have a silvery sheen, it doesn’t need more light than its counterparts without silver and can thrive in darker locations.
Without high humidity, it won’t root into moss poles. A bamboo stake will do.

A Wendlandii outside of display cases doesn’t necessarily need a moss pole. Below 60 to 70% humidity, too few aerial roots form, risking root rot if the substrate is not airy enough. However, a stake is recommended for a beautiful growth, especially if you desire the three-parted adult leaves.

## Personal Experience

My Syngonium is positioned by the east window, receiving direct morning sunlight and experiencing slightly cooler temperatures of 18 to 20°C in winter. Even during the height of summer, temperatures rarely exceed 25°C. The humidity usually hovers around 40 to 45%, occasionally dropping to 35%. In the past, I had it in a moss pole setup with humidity maintained at 60 to 70%, and it thrived.

However, the moss pole wasn’t necessary, as the plant never embraced it, often leading to overly damp substrate. Despite this, the support structure brought visible delight to the Syngonium.

In general, it proves remarkably robust, enduring various conditions under my care, and certainly does not exhibit diva-like tendencies!

## Propagation

Like other Syngoniums, Wendlandii rarely blooms indoors. Thus, propagation through cuttings takes precedence.
It appreciates a support for climbing.

As it grows quickly, branching out from the stem and becoming bushier, pruning is a wise choice. The cutting should then root well. However, more patience is required here compared to many other Syngoniums, as root initiation often takes time.
