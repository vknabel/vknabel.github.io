Starting with this year, I have decided to discontinue all of my open source projects.

Most notably this affects my VS Code extensions for Swift.
I archieved the repositories and requested to deprecate the extensions in the Visual Studio Marketplace.

Also I decided to stop my work on my toy programming language.

## Reasoning

Since a few years I shifted my focus from Swift development to Go and Kubernetes and switched my main editor from VS Code to Helix.

And I found joy in so many different things that can be done without computers. Doing some side projects just isn't worth the hassle for me anymore.

Occasionally I will still write some blog posts and update my non-archived repositories.
