Featuring bright green to golden leaves with hints of red, the Philodendron Malay Gold is a classic representative of its kind – just brighter. For those who appreciate the color but not necessarily the growth form, alternatives such as Philodendron Hederaceaum ‚Lemon Lime‘ (a.k.a. Scandens) or Epipremnum Aureum ‚Neon‘ are available.

New leaves emerge neon yellow and gradually turn greener over time, maintaining a relatively light hue. The leaf stems, especially at the base, showcase a reddish tint. The more light it receives, the more intense the coloring becomes. The leaves have rounded bases, lack the typical „ears,“ and do not grow particularly large.

## Care

Like most Philodendrons, the Malay Gold is exceptionally robust. The advantage of easily assessing the lighting conditions based on new leaves provides timely feedback after relocation. While it cannot thrive in as low light conditions as some of its counterparts, it does not demand an exceptionally bright location either.

It simply wants to grow tall and fast, with an inherent upward trajectory. Although the stem is typically broader than that of a Melanochrysum, a support structure becomes necessary at a certain height. While it would likely accept a moss pole, it is not strictly necessary.
Personal Experience

The Malay Gold has adorned various corners of my home: in winter on the south side, centrally located, on the east and west sides directly by the window. Maintaining humidity levels between 30% and 60%. Notably, there were no significant issues in any of these placements.

It has even stood directly next to the open balcony door in summer and fall, welcoming thrips that occasionally find their way in. While a mild infestation occurred, it caused no substantial harm. Other pests have never been a concern.

Given its size, the water requirements for our plant are relatively modest. Thanks to its determination to grow upward, its space requirements are also manageable.

## Propagation

It’s needless to say that propagating a Philodendron is at best a challenging task. The Malay Gold is no exception and is most effectively propagated through cuttings. The advantage lies in its ability to develop aerial roots even in moderate humidity conditions, facilitating an effortless rooting process for cuttings that swiftly establish themselves as independent plants.
