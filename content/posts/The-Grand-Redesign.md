Nine years ago I launched this blog to share some thoughts about software development. Most of the time I have been very strict about content that I posted. If it wasn't tech, I didn't post it.

Over the years my priorities shifted. I even started a new blog to open up a new niche. But in the end I decided to not restrict myself in terms of topics. Let's see where this leads me to.

## How it started

Back in February 2017, that's _nine freaking years_ ago, I launched this blog. I just picked some template and some static site generator to get started.
The blog was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/static-site-generator/) with some simple theme.

## The problem with Gatsby

With the years I was increasingly frustrated with Gatsby. I wanted a simple blog, nothing too crazy client side stuff. But essentially that was the focus of Gatsby: web workers and lots of JavaScript.

When I left day to day web development, I also switched to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). After all the hassle this was a breeze! I picked a new theme that was simple, but less basic and had a touch of color.

Essentially I was pretty happy with my site. But as teased above not with the topics I was writing about.
I started a new website [Aroid Garden](/tags/plants) about houseplants, but also lost focus there due to personal reasons. Eventually I sunsetted it.

## Why the redesign?

Now I decided to transform my former tech blog to a personal one. If I want to write something down, I don't want to think about wether the topic fits or not.
Writing is a habit that must be built and maintained, but I regularly focus on other stuff than tech.

Though the markdown-style design just doesn't fit the new content I want to share. That's why I decided to go with the redesign.
As it's been a great choice I sticked to Hugo, but couldn't find a theme that fit my needs, so I rolled my own. For technical details about this site see [Colophon](/colophon), which will be updated in the future.

I know there are still some rough edges around the design, but better ship, than procrastinate.

## What about the content?

When mixing many topics, it makes sense to provide ways to navigate and filter it more easily.

- refactored the tags that grew over the years (I had `go` and `golang`)
- separate [RSS feeds](/rss) for the blog, library and one for all content

I also provide additional content like:

- a book [library](/library) to share book recommendatations
- a [now](/now) page to share what I'm currently doing
- the [colophon](/colophon) to share technical details about the site
- my list of [projects](/projects)
- and [sovereignity](/sovereignity) to share my efforts to regain control over my data and online presence

Also some updated content:

- the [about](/about) page was just outdated
- I imported the Aroid Garden posts to the [plants tag](/tags/plants), though the layout isn't optimized for it

In the end, when you have a look at [Home](/), you cannot come around to see that my content has changed.
And that this is just the beginning.
