This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The whole source code and configuration can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vknabel/vknabel.github.io).

The theme is hand-written and also available in the same repository.
If you wonder what the previous template was: [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie).

The fonts I use are:

- [Lora](https://www.cyreal.org/fonts/lora/) by Cyreal. It's mostly used for headings and the logo.
- [Inria Serif](https://github.com/BlackFoundryCom/InriaFonts) by Black Foundry. Used for body text.
- [Monaspace Argon](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) by GitHub. Used for code snippets.

The color scheme loosely oriented around these colors from the [Fiery Passion Blend](https://coolors.co/palette/4f000b-720026-ce4257-ff7f51), then piped through a Tailwind CSS color palette generator and now has different hexes.
