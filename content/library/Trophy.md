This book captivates from the very first minute.
At its core are the moral beliefs of a hunter and where they can lead.
There is no judgment—just the story told from his perspective.

At times, his thought processes are almost unbearable to read when they fundamentally clash with your own beliefs. Roughly halfway through, the story provides an outlet for the internal conflict you feel.

The book takes a clear stance without preaching, without condemning, without jumping to conclusions. The story stands on its own and resolves the contradiction through its plot.

I can wholeheartedly recommend it.
