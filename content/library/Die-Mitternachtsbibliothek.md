The book opens with a shocking moment. Trigger warning: themes of suicide and depression.

After that, the pace slows and the story gradually draws you in.
While it may not be thrilling in the classic sense, it captivates on a different level.

It's a moving and wondrous book, written at a cosy pace that never becomes boring.
Overall, it's still a feel-good book.
