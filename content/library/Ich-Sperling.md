The story is told from the perspective of a young boy in ancient Rome who grows up in a brothel.

Some intense topics are brought up and talked about. But a lot of it is left to the reader's imagination. So, luckily, the most intense topics are left out but still talked about.

At times, while reading, you already have a premonition of what will happen in the next chapter. You feel and share the excitement. An intense book, but one of my favorites.
