title: "Library"

I regularly read books and now started writing little reviews here and do some recommendations.
I prefer fiction in German and English and non-fiction in German, but I am open to all kinds of books and love to discover new authors.

These recommendations and reviews are kept short, concise and mostly free of spoilers. The focus on these is more tailored around the feelings I had while reading and the vibe of the book, not it's story.
