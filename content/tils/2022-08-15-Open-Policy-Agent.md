With OPA you implement decisions of policies, not their enforcement. This avoids confusion between multiple servers that might come from different implementations of the policies.

The decisions themselves are implemented using the Regi programming language.

Similar to Prolog, Rego is a declarative and logic programming language. A seldom choice, but a great fit for policies!
