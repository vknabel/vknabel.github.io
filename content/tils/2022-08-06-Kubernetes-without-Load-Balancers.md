All the hosted Kubernetes solutions I know of want you to pay roughly 10$ pre month for each load balancer.

If you currently don't expect much traffic, but want to play around with k8s or if many docker-compose files don't fit your needs anymore, this easily doubles your costs.

> Bonus learning: I didn't heard of the `DaemonSet` until now!
