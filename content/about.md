Iâ€™m Valentin Knabel, vknabel on [GitHub](https://github.com/vknabel) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vknabel). I maintain several open source projects including the [Maintained Swift Development Environment](https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment) extension for Visual Studio Code.

Currently I work at [oput](https://oput.de) mostly doing iOS and web development. In my free time I mainly work on developer tooling like improving VS Code support for the Swift ecosystem and on my own toy-programming language written in Go, of course, including a Docker image, a Language Server and a VS Code extension.
