I’m Valentin Knabel, a developer, a cyclist, coffee nerd, vegan and a human.
When possible I prefer real-world stuff, open source and privacy.

I value simplicity, kindness and honesty. It is fine to be imperfect, as long as  we are honest and have fun along the way.

Usually I am `@vknabel` everywhere like on [GitHub](https://github.com/vknabel) and [@mastodon.social@vknabel](https://mastodon.social/@vknabel)

I work at [x-cellent](https://www.x-cellent.com) on [metal-stack](https://metal-stack.io).
